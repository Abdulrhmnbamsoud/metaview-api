cnn_world,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,"So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 90 million income tax returns for 2022.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 20:07:40 GMT",2023-04-14 20:07:40,"So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022. That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Related article Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit . (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Interest on your savings Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains) Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle Unemployment income Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account Tips Gambling winnings Income from a rental property you own Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600 .) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received. “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer . Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file. Related article Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday. You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18. Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee . Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

cnn_world,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:29:52 GMT",2023-04-14 14:29:52,"Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month. Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts. That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February. However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year. The effect of smaller tax returns Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say. “March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN. Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth. Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report. A slowing labor market Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month. Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported. The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then. The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. “On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release. “Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days. Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday. It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case. A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way. I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes. The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before. But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.","Analysis: Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone This is it.

This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument. Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air. In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice. Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.",Security,United States,NEGATIVE,0.7297853231430054
cnn_world,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color,"When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 21:13:04 GMT",2023-04-13 21:13:04,"When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.” Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. “When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding. Many women and people of color say they are turned away Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey , a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans. In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. “We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them. “The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her. “The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. SVB’s collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. “I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN. Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase . But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’”","Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought , the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found , Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers , according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows , triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.”","Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Lake Powell , the second-largest human-made reservoir in the US, has lost nearly 7% of its potential storage capacity since 1963, when Glen Canyon Dam was built, a new report shows.

The report by IQAir , a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines , which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir . It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines , which were updated in September 2021 . The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma , heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.” Related article Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it? Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July. China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest , which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said. Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.”","These were the best and worst places for air quality in 2021, new report shows Air pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report.

The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company . (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Related article Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you look As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable , told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.” Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities . Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN. Related article Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” What’s the holdup? Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report . It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  Walmart — 842,700 Target — 259,900 Home Depot — 256,600 Kroger — 192,500 Costco — 87,500 Source:  Environment America, Frontier Group report, “Solar on Superstores”  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said. Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.” Related article 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House , said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” Acting on climate, equitably For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Related article Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report.","Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more . “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints. Related article Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet “There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.” Simply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics. Eggs vs. oil Compared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light. Because making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue. “The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.” The chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said. “On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet. A direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child. “Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said. One reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.” Because wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint. New understanding of the classics Another painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements. “We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.” However, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more . “Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study. Trace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints.

Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent. Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations. Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world. Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers). READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison. Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde. Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.” Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.” The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression. READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women. The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.” On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor : “If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.” The bunnies next door The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans. “The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy. “The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right. They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers. The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated. The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances. In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent. READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth Fan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show. Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women. Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing. In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.

Inside fashion's worrying runway trend,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it's clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-week-fall-winter-2023-size-diversity-skinny-wegovy/index.html,"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 20:53:38 GMT",2023-04-06 20:53:38,"Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Related article Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. The Fall-Winter failings In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that  68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above . “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. It starts with sample size Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Related article Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment.  “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine  declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” A case for change Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue , unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption , unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes. In his own social media post , Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways.  “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.” But for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.” Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.” ‘No such thing as a free lunch’ On March 8, Wegovy  — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010. Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion. While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk. On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release. Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations . And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements. “I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said. Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN. Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Every body is invited Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty. “There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.” Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too. “It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns. Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.”","'A definitive backslide.' Inside fashion's worrying runway trend Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats. Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade. Related article Dior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy. For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away. The Fall-Winter failings In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others. Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that  68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above . “It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment. “Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.” For others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.” That said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies. There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models. It starts with sample size Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show. It’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.” Related article Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion But despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.” Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples. London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment.  “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.” Burns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine  declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?” A case for change Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.” For British Vogue’s April issue , unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry. “Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption , unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.” But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes.

cnn_world,The surreal facades of America's strip clubs,"Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francois-prost-gentlemens-club/index.html,"Mon, 06 Mar 2023 14:13:40 GMT",2023-03-06 14:13:40,"Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America : strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “ Gentlemen’s Club ” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Related article Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” ‘A bit strange’ The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “ After Party ,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. Related article From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Related article Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers.

But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America : strip clubs. From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “ Gentlemen’s Club ” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades. Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states. “I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email. The first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.” Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project. Related article Artful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence “The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March. ”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.” ‘A bit strange’ The genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “ After Party ,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project. As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside. Related article From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls “A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said. Miami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings. If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project. “Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers. “Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said. Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.” Related article Giant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers. “I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.” Objects of desire The facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up.

Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here.

Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry. Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft.

For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience. Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage. In conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve.

He survived, and here's his advice",Paul Templer was living his best life.,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 12:44:43 GMT",2023-04-12 12:44:43,"Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” A good day for a river trek March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Possible trouble ahead Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Attempting a rescue Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” Hippos: Huge, territorial and dangerous There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic . They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees . Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines , which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. Hippos and humans They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. Related article How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. ‘He spat me out’ Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. Total fury “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath.  When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. Who gets attacked and why People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. Related article You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Stuck on a rock and in a hard place Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Next ordeal: Getting medical help Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.

It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” How to stay safe in hippo country Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.” Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.” “Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce. Warning signals Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting. “These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said. If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill. Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.

What if you’re in a small watercraft? “Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.” It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said. Once an attack is underway Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins. “Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order. Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison “Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said. Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.” Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go. ‘You’re the sum of your choices’ Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers). How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life? After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.” Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.” Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me” ; and is a speaker. Is a safari advisable? Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s? Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association ,” he said. Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run. “My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.”","'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice Paul Templer was living his best life. He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris. He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.” Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos. “It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.” A good day for a river trek March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.” The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak. And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.” Possible trouble ahead Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.” Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened. Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer “Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow. “Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked. Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb. Attempting a rescue Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe. “I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said. “But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.” He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf. “I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.” What happened next was nightmarish and surreal. “My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on. “From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t. “I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.” Hippos: Huge, territorial and dangerous There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic . They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees . Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines , which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half. They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie). Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles. Hippos and humans They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported. “The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview. Related article How to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely “I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.” Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either. While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%. ‘He spat me out’ Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer. “I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ” So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.” He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time. “This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself. “I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.” This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth. Total fury “And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said. “For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath.  When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart. Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.” He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes. Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.” The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though. Who gets attacked and why People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison. “Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said. Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said. Related article You encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos. “Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said. “Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.” Stuck on a rock and in a hard place Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.” Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.” He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered. “My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.” Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks. Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock. He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back. He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?” It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack “I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.” Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him. “Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.” Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock. “And that was my bad day at the office.” Next ordeal: Getting medical help Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods. It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live. But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation. Related article If you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.” But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.” He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.” How to stay safe in hippo country Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place. “Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said. “Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.” Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses. Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said. “Follow the rules.

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka , which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” Related article This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home Guesthouse dream When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065 , this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Related article Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Ghost house Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Authentic style Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” Lengthy process He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program , which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” Complete transformation He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley , 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan","They bought an abandoned 'ghost house' in the Japanese countryside Editor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter .

He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse. In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture. However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada. He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka , which are usually passed down over generations. “I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.” Related article This US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home Guesthouse dream When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country. As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.” According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065 , this number is likely to increase. Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her. “I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls. He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river. Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling. “The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.” Related article Expats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for Ghost house Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned. While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner. “They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says. Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot. “It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city]. “The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.” According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items. During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so. Authentic style Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes. He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000. “I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background. “From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.” Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials. He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses. “They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted. “The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.” He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago. “It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.” Lengthy process He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program , which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help. After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse. As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses. “This is how I started farming,” he says. In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests. “It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.” He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker. “I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India. “People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.” Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her. “We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.” While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished. “It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.” Complete transformation He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations. “Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits. Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. “Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house. “Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here. “So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].” Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent. “People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.” As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley. “She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.” Yui Valley , 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan",Energy,United Kingdom,POSITIVE,0.9991976618766785

The full list is here. A new $650 million airport opens its doors After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021. With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism. Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway. A modern new museum The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history. With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost. The museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge. Mongolia’s answer to Coachella When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind. But that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime , Spirit of Gobi , INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience .

While the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago. Today, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan. A seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town.

In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China . I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. Related article What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) Yongtai Turtle City The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies. Related article Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu/Jiankou Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Related article Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019 , so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. Related article China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. Laoniuwan (aka the Old Ox Bend Great Wall) As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Related article Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: L aoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Fairy Tower Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Dushikou Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province. The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks. Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather. You’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from. Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious. Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car.","The most beautiful sections of China's Great Wall Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China . I’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces. Looking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries. Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control. Work eventually stopped in the 17th century. Related article What's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties. And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion. Whether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.) Yongtai Turtle City The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.” The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use. Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province. While there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape. The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time. Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos. When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies.

The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). Mutianyu/Jiankou Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops. Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement. These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience. Mutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top. Related article Off-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns. Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows. Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home. For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice. In fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos. For winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu. Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019 , so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station. Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. Bataizi Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary. The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing. The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon. Related article China's best new outdoor attractions After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism. Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable. Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills. Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive. Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43). Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi. In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites. Laoniuwan (aka the Old Ox Bend Great Wall) As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands. The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544. Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia. Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure. Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning. A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects. Related article Swell life: China's surf scene is heating up Getting there: L aoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year. Fairy Tower Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty. The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access. Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear. As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction. The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side. It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson. Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites. Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district. Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there. You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there. Dushikou Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones. It’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province.

Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes . Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage  that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. “The world is your oyster when you are educated” Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.” A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. Related article This CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. “When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. “I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which  computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.

So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. “We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.” The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. “My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” An inspiring night of heroism and advocacy CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. “We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.” Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly , who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. “From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

bbc_world,US immigration agent fatally shoots woman in Minneapolis,Trump says the woman was attempting to run over ICE agents. Local leaders disagree.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jvnl4j1n4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:58:22 GMT",2026-01-08 09:58:22,"A US immigration agent has shot dead a 37-year-old woman in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight. Federal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street. As it attempts to drive off, one of them points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. The FBI is investigating. Hundreds of ICE agents have been deployed to Minneapolis, in the state of Minnesota, as part of the White House's crackdown on illegal immigration. Using an expletive, the city's Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey urged the agents to leave the city, following the fatal shooting. Minneapolis shooting live updates Videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time on Wednesday morning. From various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis. A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the pavement. Law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. ICE agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, emerge from the truck and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle. It's not clear exactly how close the agent is standing or whether he was struck by the vehicle based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC. That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off. The vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a car parked nearby along the street. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said an ICE officer was ""viciously"" run over. ""It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,"" he wrote. The Republican president also blamed the ""Radical Left"" for ""threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis"". Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said the driver was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. She was then approached on foot by a federal law enforcement officer, ""and she began to drive off"". Who was Renee Nicole Good, the woman killed by ICE? US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman was ""stalking and impeding"" officers throughout the day and tried to ""weaponise her vehicle"" in an attempt to run over the officer in an act of ""domestic terrorism"".

The Minneapolis City Council, however, said in a statement that Good was simply ""caring for her neighbours"" when she was shot and killed. The same agent was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June, Noem said. She added that ICE operations in the city would continue, and the FBI would investigate Wednesday's incident. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz says he will not seek re-election Trump administration says it's withholding childcare funds from Minnesota amid fraud allegations Emily Heller told CNN she was at home when she saw the ICE agents arguing with protesters outside. She said she heard agents shouting at a woman driving an SUV, then one agent tried to open her car door, and the driver went into reverse and began pulling away. ""An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, 'Stop!' and then - I mean, she was already moving - and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,"" Heller told the US network. Minnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident. ""Don't believe this propaganda machine,"" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting.

bbc_world,Footage shows violent clashes as Iran protests spread to more areas,"Semi-official Iranian media say two police were killed in a western town, as videos show security forces firing guns and tear gas at crowds elsewhere.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm4y0ewe93o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:00:28 GMT",2026-01-08 12:00:28,"There were violent clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in several locations in Iran on Wednesday, as a wave of unrest sparked by the country's economic crisis continued for an 11th day. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards, said two policemen were shot and killed by armed individuals in the south-western town of Lordegan. Videos posted on social media showed a tense stand-off between protesters and security forces, with the sound of gunfire in the background. In footage from several other areas, security forces appear to fire guns and tear gas towards crowds of protesters, some of whom are throwing stones. The protests have so far spread to 111 cities and towns across all 31 provinces, according to the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). It has reported that at least 34 protesters and four security personnel have been killed during the unrest, and that 2,200 protesters have been arrested. BBC Persian has confirmed the deaths and identities of 21 people, while Iranian authorities have reported the deaths of five security personnel. The protests began on 28 December, when shopkeepers took to the streets of the capital, Tehran, to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market. The rial has sunk to a record low over the past year and inflation has soared to 40% as sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme squeeze an economy also weakened by government mismanagement and corruption. University students soon joined the protests and they began spreading to other cities, with crowds frequently heard chanting slogans against the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and sometimes in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's late former shah. At least 36 people killed during Iran protests, rights group says Iran anti-government protests spread to majority of provinces, videos show Protests and US warnings shake Iran at its weakest point in years On Wednesday, videos verified by BBC Persian showed crowds protesting in Qazvin , north-west of Tehran, and chanting slogans including ""Death to the dictator"" - a reference to Khamenei - as well as ""Long live the shah"". Footage from the Gulf port of Bandar Abbas , showed protesters chanting ""Police force, support, support"" before security forces disperse them. In the Shia holy city of Mashhad, in the country's north-east, protesters were seen clashing with security forces and forcing them to retreat . Another video showed people chanting in support of the Pahlavi dynasty, which was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution. In the late afternoon, a large demonstration also took place in the south-western city of Abadan , near the border with Iraq, according to footage verified by BBC Persian, in which protesters chanted ""Cannon, tanks, firecrackers! Mullahs must get lost"", a reference to Iran's clerical leadership. More footage filmed from a balcony in the city appeared to show security forces opening fire as they run away from advancing protesters , who are throwing stones and other objects. As night fell, security forces were filmed firing tear gas to disperse a protest in Aligudarz , another western city, after a crowd had gathered in a square chanting ""People's uprising, Viva!"" Footage also emerged of protesters in Qaemyeh, Fars province, toppling a statue of Qasem Soleimani, head of the elite Quds Force and one of the most powerful figures in Iran, who was killed in a US air strike on the orders of Donald Trump in 2020.  In Lordegan, Fars reported that two police officers were killed during a protest on Wednesday. It added that the officers, whom it named as Hadi Azarsalim and Moslem Mahdavinasab, were shot dead by ""armed individuals"" who had been among a group of what it called ""rioters"". It was not immediately possible to verify the report because the BBC and other independent international media are either not allowed to report from inside Iran or, if granted permission, face severe restrictions on their movements. However, Lordegan has been the scene of violent clashes during the unrest, with two protesters killed there last Thursday. Following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Vice-President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Jafar Qaempanah said President Masoud Pezeshkian had ordered that ""no security measures"" be taken against peaceful protesters. ""Those who carry firearms, knives and machetes and who attack police stations and military sites are rioters, and we must distinguish protesters from rioters,"" he added. State media also reported that the government had begun paying 71 million citizens a new monthly allowance equivalent to $7 (£5) to ease the pain of the high cost of living. Meanwhile, judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei told police commanders that ""rioters"" would face ""rapid"" prosecution and punishment in order to serve as a deterrent. Khamenei - who, as supreme leader, has ultimate power in Iran - said on Saturday that authorities should ""speak with the protesters"" but that ""rioters should be put in their place"". His comments came after Trump threatened that the US would intervene if Iranian security forces killed peaceful protesters, saying: ""We are locked and loaded."" Dr Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House, told the BBC that the protests had quickly become political and were being driven by deep-seated anger among the public. ""People are fed up. They have no prospects for the future. Day-to-day life is becoming much more difficult,"" she said. ""If there is more momentum and if more people come out, [the protests] will be more serious and, of course, there the government response becomes more violent."" Sadegh Zibakalam, a political science professor at the University of Tehran, said the Iranian authorities might be resisting a harsher crackdown because of Trump's threats. ""Some Iranian leaders - Revolutionary Guard commanders and security forces - maybe they are a bit more cautious and are not in a hurry to suppress the crowd this time fearing it may create an American intervention,"" he told the BBC. The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained in a violent crackdown on those protests by security forces, according to human rights groups.","Footage shows violent clashes as Iran protests spread to more areas There were violent clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in several locations in Iran on Wednesday, as a wave of unrest sparked by the country's economic crisis continued for an 11th day.

bbc_world,Vance criticises Denmark and Europe's handling of 'critical' Greenland,European allies of Denmark have rejected Trump's ideas to annex the semi-autonomous territory.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lgjd51v95o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:18:14 GMT",2026-01-08 15:18:14,"US Vice-President JD Vance says Greenland is ""critical"" for the defence of the US and the world against possible Russian or Chinese missile attacks - and that Europe and Denmark have ""not done a good job"" in securing the area. Vance told Fox News that they had not only under-invested in Greenland's defences, but also failed to engage with President Donald Trump's argument over the issue. US officials are ""actively"" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - the White House said on Wednesday, a day after suggesting military action to annex it to the US was also an option. Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale. Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. 'We are not for sale': Greenlanders express fear and indignation as Trump eyes territory How could Donald Trump 'take' Greenland? Why does Trump want Greenland and what could it mean for Nato? In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves. ""People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland,"" Vance said in his interview on Wednesday. ""If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. ""So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?' And the answer is obviously they haven't,"" he said. Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he would hold talks with Denmark next week. A day earlier, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark. ""Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,"" the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement. Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, ""collectively"". They also called for ""upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders"". Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were ""a clear threat"". ""It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,"" she said. But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely and that instead, ""what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time"". Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership.

Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen Does the US have the right to take over Greenland? The painful questions for Nato and the EU as Trump threatens Greenland","Vance criticises Denmark and Europe's handling of 'critical' Greenland US Vice-President JD Vance says Greenland is ""critical"" for the defence of the US and the world against possible Russian or Chinese missile attacks - and that Europe and Denmark have ""not done a good job"" in securing the area. Vance told Fox News that they had not only under-invested in Greenland's defences, but also failed to engage with President Donald Trump's argument over the issue. US officials are ""actively"" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - the White House said on Wednesday, a day after suggesting military action to annex it to the US was also an option. Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale. Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. 'We are not for sale': Greenlanders express fear and indignation as Trump eyes territory How could Donald Trump 'take' Greenland? Why does Trump want Greenland and what could it mean for Nato? In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves. ""People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland,"" Vance said in his interview on Wednesday. ""If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. ""So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?' And the answer is obviously they haven't,"" he said. Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he would hold talks with Denmark next week. A day earlier, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark. ""Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,"" the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement. Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, ""collectively"". They also called for ""upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders"". Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were ""a clear threat"". ""It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,"" she said. But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely and that instead, ""what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time"". Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership. ""It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,"" he told the BBC. ""We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government."" Saying that he did not have ""time for Trump"", he added that people were ""in need"".

The White House said the decision was taken because those entities ""no longer serve American interests"" and promote ""ineffective or hostile agendas"". The memorandum was signed on Wednesday following a review, with the White House describing the organisations as ""a waste of taxpayer dollars"". ""These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,"" it said in a statement. It added that many of the organisations promoted ""radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength"".

Sources within the organisation told the BBC that they were concerned about the potential impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal on US scientists involved in producing the body's next set of studies. The White House has already blocked US scientists attending a meeting in China. Any restrictions on travel or the participation of US researchers could significantly delay the release of the next set of IPCC reports, including potentially its mitigation report - a key document guiding governments on how to tackle climate change.

While the US constitution allows presidents to join treaties ""provided two thirds of Senators present concur"", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw.

Nine people were detained on Tuesday after police raided their homes and the church office in Chengdu, in central China, the Early Rain Covenant Church said. Five had been released by Wednesday. More than 1,000 miles away in Wenzhou, authorities began demolishing the Yayang Church building, video obtained by non-profit ChinaAid, which monitors religious persecution, shows. This latest wave of arrests, after others last year, shows the Communist Party's resolve to snuff out churches that do not align with its ideology, Christian groups say. The BBC has contacted China's embassy in the UK for comment. Authorities have not made any statements about the arrests or the demolition in Wenzhou. China promotes atheism and controls religion. The government said in 2018 that there were 44 million Christians in the country, but it's unclear if that number includes those who attend the many underground churches. The Communist Party has long pressured Christians to join only state-sanctioned churches led by government-approved pastors. But Christian groups say the grip has tightened noticeably, with arrests becoming more common and prompt. At least two church leaders in China have told the BBC that authorities are swiftly arresting unauthorised church leaders. In the past, these individuals would first be warned, then fined and finally detained if they still refused to comply with orders. Just weeks ago, Li Yingqiang, the current leader of Early Rain Covenant Church, had said he ""sensed a storm gathering"" and referred to ""the imminent prospect of... another large-scale crackdown"". ""I dearly hope that none of our families shall ever again endure such a storm,"" he wrote in a letter to church members in November. ""Yet as an elder appointed by the Lord to stand among you... it is my duty to remind you all to prepare yourselves before the storm returns."" Mr Li and his wife, Zhang Xinyue, are among the four who remain in detention. Their church described the arrests as a ""concerted operation"" but said the grounds for arrest, and whether those detained had been charged, remain unclear. It added that it had lost contact with two other members but did not say they had been detained. ""The situation is ongoing, with specific details yet to be fully confirmed,"" Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) said in a statement to members and supporters. It also also sought prayers for its members' safety and their perseverance in the Christian faith. In Wenzhou, local authorities brought in bulldozers, cranes and heavy machinery earlier this week to start taking down part of the Yayang Church building, as seen in the video. ChinaAid said it was told by multiple sources that hundreds of armed and special police officers have been deployed to stand guard outside the building. Sometimes known as ""the Jerusalem of China"", Wenzhou has more Christians than any other city in the country. Residents living near Yayang Church have been ""driven away"", while those working in the area has been instructed not to take photographs or record video, ChinaAid said. ""The massive mobilisation against the two major independent church networks shows the central government is determined to stamp out Christian churches entirely, unless the church is totally indoctrinated into the party's ideology,"" said Bob Fu, who founded ChinaAid. In December, authorities arrested about 100 members of Yayang Church in Wenzhou over five days. At least 24 members remain in custody, according to Human Rights Watch. And in October last year, 30 leaders of Zion Church - one of China's biggest underground churches - were rounded up across seven cities. Founder Ezra Jin is still in custody. The Chinese government has also targeted the Early Rain Covenant Church, founded in 2008, for years. In 2018, authorities raided the Church and arrested founding pastor Wang Yi and his wife Jiang Rong. At least 100 church members were taken into custody in the following days in one of China's largest crackdowns on churches in the past decade. Mr Wang, an outspoken critic of the Communist Party's policies on religion, was jailed for ""inciting subversion of state power"" and ""illegal business operations"". He is due to be released in 2027. The church has continued to gather online and sometimes replays Mr Wang's recorded sermons to its members. ""Xi Jinping's government has tightened ideological control and intensified its intolerance of loyalties beyond the Chinese Communist Party,"" said Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, referring to the Chinese premier. ""Concerned governments and religious leaders around the world should press the Chinese government to free detained religious adherents and respect religious freedom in China."" Under Xi, China has increased its control on religious freedom. Since 2015, he has called for the ""Sinicisation of religions"", which requires religious doctrines and practices to conform with Chinese culture and values.

Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards are estimated by the government to have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Church figures. The move follows similar redress schemes in other nations where abuse has been uncovered. ""A democracy should not allow the existence of victims who have never been compensated [and] whose situation, on the contrary, had been covered up,"" said Justice Minister Félix Bolaños after signing the agreement.

Argüello, who is archbishop of Valladolid, described the accord as ""another step forward along the path that for years we have been travelling"". A 2023 study by the Spanish ombudsman's office, which investigates public complaints, estimated that 1.1% of the population had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of members of the clergy or individuals linked to the Church - the equivalent of 440,000 people. The Church has contested these findings. It set up a reparation scheme that year to manage abuse claims. However, both the Socialist-led government and victims' organisations have been dissatisfied with the scheme's model, which did not allow input or oversight from outside the Church. In November, the Church said that 58 cases had been ""resolved"" under its framework. However, critics accused the institution of a lack of transparency and slowness. Newspaper El País, which has created a database of clerical abuse allegations, has documented cases affecting 2,948 victims dating back as far as the 1940s. Last June, several victims' groups broke off ties with the Spanish Church, alleging that it had excluded them from seeking reparations. The Vatican subsequently appeared to take a more prominent role, with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors meeting Spanish victims and urging the country's Catholic leaders to bolster and facilitate reparations. Meetings between Justice Minister Bolaños and the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appear to have raised the pressure further on the Church authorities in Madrid. Under the new system, victims will be able to file their cases before a new agency created by the justice ministry, which will then take them before the ombusdman's office, which will draw up a reparation proposal. The Church must then agree to the proposed compensation – if not, the case will be referred back to the ombudsman. Reparation can be symbolic, psychological, or economic, according to the agreement. In each case, the Church is responsible for its execution. The amount of financial compensation that could be paid out is not specified. However, the ombudsman has suggested following the lead of other European countries. In Belgium, an average of €6,000 ($7,000; £5,210) has been paid to victims in such cases, although the late Pope Francis described that amount as ""too small"".

He told the New York Times that ""only time will tell"" how long his administration would ""oversee"" the running of the South American nation following the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Saturday. Trump also did not say if or when elections would be held in Venezuela to replace the interim government headed by Maduro loyalist Delcy Rodríguez. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said the ouster of Maduro had set off an ""irreversible process"" that would lead Venezuela to be ""free"". New York Times (NYT) journalists quizzed Trump on his plans for the future of Venezuela days after he had said his administration would run the oil-rich nation. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House had said that the US would control sales of sanctioned oil ""indefinitely"". US Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the US needed control over Venezuela's oil sales for leverage over the interim government in Caracas. Trump said his administration would be ""taking oil"" from Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven reserves, but acknowledged it would ""take a while"" to get the country's oil industry up and running. Venezuela's oil production has plummeted as a result of mismanagement on the part of the Maduro government and that of his predecessor, as well as years of US sanctions. Trump told the NYT that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was ""in constant communication"" with Rodríguez, who was designated as Venezuela's interim leader by the country's Supreme Court, which is dominated by Maduro loyalists. He added that Rodríguez is ""giving us everything that we feel is necessary."" The US president had earlier said that the interim government had agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to buy only US-made goods. According to the NYT reporters, Trump did not answer their questions about why he recognised Rodríguez as Venezuela's new leader. Many Venezuela analysts had expected that the ouster of Maduro would be followed swiftly by the return to the country of opposition leaders Edmundo González and María Corina Machado. But in his first news conference following the US raid, Trump was dismissive about  Machado, alleging that she lacked the ""respect"" and support to lead Venezuela. ""I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,"" he said. Machado managed to unite opposition groups behind her ahead of the 2024 presidential election but was barred from running for the presidency by officials loyal to the Maduro government. She then threw her weight behind former diplomat González, who acted as her proxy. The electoral council, which is also dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro re-elected. However, voting tallies collected by the opposition, which have been independently verified, suggest González won by a landslide. González went into exile to escape the government repression that followed the election, and Machado went into hiding within Venezuela. She embarked on a perilous journey by land, sea and air to reach Oslo in December to collect the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded for her ""tireless work promoting democratic rights"" in Venezuela. Her current whereabouts are unknown but she has said that she plans to return to Venezuela soon. Analysis: Why Trump chose Maduro's VP over Nobel winner Opposition leader Machado says her coalition should lead Venezuela In an interview with Venezuelan opposition news site La Patilla , she insisted that the ousting of Maduro had set her country on an irreversible path towards freedom. She said that she hoped this new phase of the transition process would be ""as short and swift as possible"". She added that the interim government, which she said was ""the same regime it was under Maduro"" was ""being given instructions to dismantle itself"". Machado insisted that González was the legitimate president-elect and urged that his mandate be respected. She stressed that ""the first thing"" that needed to happen was for the political prisoners to be released. Machado is not the only one who has been demanding that the more than 800 political prisoners held in Venezuela's notorious jails be freed. On Wednesday, Republican lawmaker María Elvira Salazar published several posts on social media insisting they be released ""immediately"". However, in his interview with the NYT, Trump instead ""appeared far more focused on the rescue mission than the details of how to navigate Venezuela's future"", according to the journalists who spoke to him. Pressed on what the US plans for Venezuela are, he said that ""we will rebuild it in a very profitable way"". He added: ""We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need.""

He told the New York Times that ""only time will tell"" how long his administration would ""oversee"" the running of the South American nation following the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Saturday. Trump also did not say if or when elections would be held in Venezuela to replace the interim government headed by Maduro loyalist Delcy Rodríguez. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said the ouster of Maduro had set off an ""irreversible process"" that would lead Venezuela to be ""free"".

Lebanon has been under intense international pressure, particularly from the US, to disarm Hezbollah, a powerful militia and political party, since a ceasefire deal in November 2024 ended a devastating year-long war between Israel and Hezbollah. The army had set a year-end deadline to clear the area south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, of non-state weapons in the first phase of a government-backed plan. The army said its objective had been achieved in an ""effective and tangible way"" but that there was more work to be done to clear unexploded ordnance and tunnels. Responding to the Lebanese army's statement, the office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said efforts toward fully disarming Hezbollah were ""an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah's efforts to rearm and rebuild its terror infrastructure with Iranian support"". In recent months, Lebanese soldiers have dismantled infrastructure in areas once controlled by Hezbollah in the south without facing resistance from the group, which says it has complied with the ceasefire deal and removed its fighters from those areas, where Palestinian factions including Hamas had also operated. But US and Israeli officials have expressed frustration with the pace of the army's efforts. Israel has accused Hezbollah - which is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and the UK - of trying to recover its military capabilities, including in the south. In recent days, Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had been given a green light by US President Donald Trump to intensify its military campaign against Hezbollah. Year after ceasefire, peace eludes south Lebanon as Israeli strikes continue Despite the ceasefire, Israel has carried out near-daily attacks on targets it says are linked to Hezbollah and continues to occupy at least five positions in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese government rejects the Israeli claims, and says Israel's actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and an obstacle to the army's efforts. Israel has not made the evidence it says it has about Hezbollah's activities public, and the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as Unifil, says it has seen no indication that the group is rebuilding its infrastructure in the areas where it operates. Lebanese officials say the next stage of the army's plan will focus on the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which includes the port city of Sidon. There is no timeline for that, and the cash-strapped Lebanese army has also complained of insufficient funding and equipment. Meanwhile, it is unclear if Hezbollah will resist the measures in other areas as it says it will not disarm north of the Litani. The group also has a strong presence in the eastern Bekaa valley and in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahieh. Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has rejected the use of force against the group, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to violence. Hezbollah - which is also a political party with representation in parliament and in the government, and a social movement that runs hospitals and schools - still enjoys significant support among Lebanon's Shia community. Opponents, however, see this as a unique opportunity to disarm the group, after its losses in the war. Hezbollah, so far, has rejected calls from the authorities to discuss the future of its weapons. In Lebanon's south, tens of thousands of residents remain displaced and communities lie in ruins, as Lebanon's international partners have conditioned funds for reconstruction on measures that include action against Hezbollah.","Lebanese army says it has taken over security in Hezbollah-dominated south The Lebanese army says it has taken over security in the south of the country, which for decades had been dominated by the Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah, amid fears that Israel could escalate its military offensive against the group.

A coalition spokesman said Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), fled Aden on Tuesday night in a boat to Somaliland. He was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the supervision of UAE officers, he added. There was no immediate comment from the UAE or STC. The STC insisted Zubaidi was still working from Aden on Wednesday, after the coalition said he had failed to fly to Riyadh for talks and had fled to an unknown location. The coalition also accused Zubaidi of moving STC forces from bases in Aden to his home province of al-Dahle and said it had carried out air strikes on them in response. The STC said the strikes, which reportedly killed four people, were ""unjustified"" and ""inconsistent"" with calls for dialogue with Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is overseen by the presidential council and backed by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been allies in the war against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement over the past decade, but the infighting between the rival factions they support has deepened a rift between them and pushed southern Yemen to the brink of a new conflict. Yemen separatist leader accused of treason as Saudi Arabia strikes forces Saudi Arabia calls for Yemeni factions to attend 'dialogue' in Riyadh UAE says it will withdraw from Yemen after Saudi strike on separatist-held port On Thursday, coalition spokesman Maj Gen Turki al-Malki said it had ""reliable intelligence"" showing Zubaidi and his associates fled from Aden's port in the early hours of Wednesday on board a St Kitts and Nevis-flagged passenger ship. The vessel sailed across the Gulf of Aden to Berbera in the breakaway region of Somaliland, where a Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft was waiting, he added. Malki said Zubaidi and his associates ""boarded the aircraft under the supervision of UAE officers"" and flew first to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, before heading towards the Arabian Sea ""without a declared destination"". ""The aircraft disabled its identification systems over the Gulf of Oman, reactivating them only 10 minutes prior to landing at Al-Reef Military Air Base in Abu Dhabi,"" he added, without saying directly whether Zubaidi was still on board. STC-aligned forces have in recent years taken control of much of southern Yemen, which they want once again to be an independent state, by pushing out forces loyal to the government. However, Saudi Arabia warned last week that the advances near the kingdom's borders constituted threats to its national security as well as the security and stability of Yemen. It also accused the UAE of ""pressuring"" its separatist allies to push into eastern Yemen and expressed support for a demand from the presidential council for all Emirati forces to leave. At the same time, the Saudi-led coalition - which was formed in 2015 by Arab states, including the UAE, after Houthi rebels seized control of north-western Yemen - struck what it said was a shipment of weapons and military vehicles for the STC that had arrived from the UAE. The UAE expressed ""deep regret"" at the Saudi accusations and denied there were any weapons, but agreed to pull its remaining forces out of the country. Since then, forces loyal to the government have retaken control of Hadramawt and al-Mahra with the help of coalition air strikes.

bbc_world,Australia PM announces royal commission into Bondi shooting,Anthony Albanese had previously resisted such an inquiry despite pressure from the Jewish community.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x94lz0gevo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:53:16 GMT",2026-01-08 07:53:16,"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month's shooting at Bondi Beach. The attack targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead, making it one of the deadliest in the country's history. Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response. But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken ""the time to reflect"" and meet with the Jewish community. ""I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity,"" he told reporters in Canberra. ""It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this."" Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission. A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers. The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise: investigating the ""nature and prevalence of antisemitism"" and its ""key drivers"" in Australia making recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attack making any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremism The prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April. Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that ""this won't be a drawn-out process."" Previous royal commissions have taken years. ""This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,"" Albanese said. Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were ""serious concerns"" about her appointment, without specifying what they were. Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was ""an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision"". Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: ""It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider."" He also added that the inquiry was not meant to ""provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East"". ""The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,"" Albanese said. In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme. Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of ""aggravated hate speech"". He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report. Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was ""the right one and an important one"". ""It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,"" she said.

Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response. But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken ""the time to reflect"" and meet with the Jewish community. ""I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity,"" he told reporters in Canberra. ""It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this."" Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission. A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers. The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise: investigating the ""nature and prevalence of antisemitism"" and its ""key drivers"" in Australia making recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attack making any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremism The prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April. Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that ""this won't be a drawn-out process."" Previous royal commissions have taken years. ""This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,"" Albanese said. Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were ""serious concerns"" about her appointment, without specifying what they were. Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was ""an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision"". Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: ""It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider."" He also added that the inquiry was not meant to ""provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East"". ""The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,"" Albanese said. In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme. Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of ""aggravated hate speech"". He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report. Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was ""the right one and an important one"". ""It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,"" she said.

Electricity supplies were also disrupted for thousands more people in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia, but power has since been restored.

Zelensky has been on a diplomatic tour this week - meeting allies in the ""Coalition of the Willing"" and US President Donald Trump's peace envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Following those talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached - a move Moscow warned would make foreign forces a ""legitimate target"". But a day later, Zelensky said European allies had not given him sound guarantees that they would protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression. However, he also said he believed Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026.

US forces boarded the Russian-flagged Marinera after a pursuit lasting almost two weeks as it travelled through the waters between Iceland and Scotland. The UK Royal Navy gave logistical support by air and sea. A second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was accused by the US of ""conducting illicit activities"" and boarded in the Caribbean. The moves come as the US seeks to choke off most exports of Venezuelan crude oil, and just days after its special forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on his residence in Caracas. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X: ""The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT - anywhere in the world."" Moscow has denounced the seizure of the tanker sailing under its flag, and demanded that the US treat Russians aboard properly and permits them to return to Russia quickly. The transport ministry said it had given the vessel ""temporary permission"" to use the Russian flag, adding that no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions. Reports suggested that Russia dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel, but it appears that US forces were able to board the tanker without facing any resistance. The White House described the ship as a ""Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel deemed stateless after flying a false flag and had a judicial order"" against it. UK forces helped US seizure of tanker, says MoD US will control Venezuela oil sales 'indefinitely', official says Venezuela's leadership is co-operating with the US on the second tanker seized in the Caribbean, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. ""They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they co-operate and work with the United States,"" he told reporters. Earlier, US President Donald Trump had said that Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - ""will be turning over"" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US. Rubio, who briefed US lawmakers on the ongoing operation in Venezuela on Wednesday, said that the US would sell oil that is in Venezuela ""in the marketplace at market rates"" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed ""in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people"". He said the US had a considered plan for the future of Venezuela, and that the administration was ""not just winging it"". Rubio said the Trump administration's plan in Venezuela was stabilisation, recovery and then transition. But the discussions surrounding oil were only one component of concern US lawmakers had over the escalating conflict. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers needed answers to lingering questions of how many US troops could be involved and how much money the US involvement in Venezuela will cost. Republicans largely appeared to back the administration's moves in the region, though some expressed concern about what kind of say Congress had. The Senate is expected to vote next week on a bipartisan war powers resolution - an attempt to block continued military action in Venezuela. A war powers resolution - created in the wake of the Vietnam War - limits a president's power to involve US armed forces in hostilities without congressional approval.

China - the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil in recent years - has condemned the US moves and accused it of threatening global energy security. The seizure of the two tankers was announced by the US military in separate posts on social media on Wednesday. The US European Command said the M/V Bella 1 - using the former name of the Marinera - was boarded ""for violations of US sanctions"". ""The vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a US federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro"", a Coast Guard cutter. Britain's Ministry of Defence said RAF surveillance aircraft and a naval support vessel, the RFA Tideforce, were among the UK military assets that took part in the operation, following a US request for assistance. Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was ""in full compliance with international law"", and ""formed part of global efforts to crack down on sanctions- busting"". The vessel has been accused of breaking US sanctions and shipping Iranian oil. Images published by Russian state broadcaster RT show a helicopter close to a ship that appears to be the M/V Bella 1. The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping shows that the tanker had changed its name to Marinera, and was sailing under the Russian flag. Its home port stated as the southern Russian city of Sochi on the Black Sea. The Russian transport ministry said US forces boarded the Marinera at about 15:00 Moscow time (1200 GMT), after which communications with the vessel were lost.

bbc_world,Cambodia extradites alleged scam mastermind to China after arrest,Chen Zhi is charged with turning his business into a front for fraud hubs that stole from people around the world.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4q8e88n2vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:29:13 GMT",2026-01-08 09:29:13,"Cambodia says it has extradited to China a billionaire businessman accused of masterminding a vast cryptocurrency scam in which trafficked workers were lured to forced labour camps to defraud victims globally. Chen Zhi was among three Chinese nationals arrested on 6 January after a joint investigation into transnational crime lasting several months, Cambodia said. The US charged the 37-year-old last October with running internet scams from Cambodia that it said had stolen billions in cryptocurrency. The UK also sanctioned his global business empire, Prince Group . Cambodian authorities have also suspended the operations of Prince Bank, a subsidiary of Prince Group. The bank has been placed in liquidation and banned from offering new banking services - though customers can still withdraw money and repay loans, the National Bank of Cambodia said on Thursday. China's state media confirmed Chen Zhi's extradition, describing him as ""the head of a major cross-border gambling and fraud syndicate... suspected of multiple crimes, including operating casinos, fraud, illegal business operations and concealing criminal proceeds"". CCTV said he had been ""placed under coercive measures in accordance with the law"". ""The public security organs will soon issue arrest warrants for the first batch of key members of Chen Zhi's criminal syndicate, resolutely bringing fugitives to justice,"" said CCTV. ""The public security organs solemnly warn criminals to recognise the situation, stop their crimes before it's too late, and immediately surrender themselves to the authorities to receive lenient treatment."" Last year, US authorities seized about $15bn (£11bn) worth of bitcoin that it alleged belonged to Chen, in what FBI Director Kash Patel described as ""one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history"". The BBC contacted Prince Group for comment at the time. In the past, the Cambodia-based group has denied any involvement in scams. Its website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. Since Chen Zhi was indicted by the US on fraud and money-laundering charges in October, his whereabouts have been unclear. But on Wednesday, the Cambodian authorities said they had ""arrested three Chinese nationals namely Chen Zhi, Xu Ji Liang, and Shao Ji Hui and extradited [them] to the People's Republic of China"". The interior ministry statement did not say where Chen Zhi had been detained. His Cambodian nationality had been revoked by royal decree last month, it added. The enigmatic tycoon had given up his Chinese nationality to become a Cambodian citizen in 2014. The mysterious figure accused of masterminding a $14bn crypto scam Bitcoin worth $14bn seized in US-UK crackdown on alleged scammers Thousands of Chinese lured abroad and forced to be scammers - now Beijing is cracking down The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to South East Asia, many of them to Cambodia, lured by the promise of legitimate jobs and then forced to run online scams. People are held against their will in the scam farms and made to defraud strangers online under the threat of punishment or torture. Many of those trapped are Chinese and targeted people in China. Chinese authorities have also been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020. The company is accused of running online fraud schemes in a number of court cases. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau established a task force to investigate the Prince Group, describing it as ""a major transnational online gambling syndicate based in Cambodia"". Cambodia's ruling elite have been close to Chen Zhi for years. The government has said little since the US and UK sanctioned Prince Group, apart from urging US and UK authorities to be sure they had sufficient evidence for their allegations. By some estimates, scam businesses may account for around half of the entire Cambodian economy. ""I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out,"" Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who has investigated Chen Zhi, told the BBC last year.

Chen Zhi was among three Chinese nationals arrested on 6 January after a joint investigation into transnational crime lasting several months, Cambodia said. The US charged the 37-year-old last October with running internet scams from Cambodia that it said had stolen billions in cryptocurrency. The UK also sanctioned his global business empire, Prince Group . Cambodian authorities have also suspended the operations of Prince Bank, a subsidiary of Prince Group. The bank has been placed in liquidation and banned from offering new banking services - though customers can still withdraw money and repay loans, the National Bank of Cambodia said on Thursday. China's state media confirmed Chen Zhi's extradition, describing him as ""the head of a major cross-border gambling and fraud syndicate... suspected of multiple crimes, including operating casinos, fraud, illegal business operations and concealing criminal proceeds"". CCTV said he had been ""placed under coercive measures in accordance with the law"". ""The public security organs will soon issue arrest warrants for the first batch of key members of Chen Zhi's criminal syndicate, resolutely bringing fugitives to justice,"" said CCTV. ""The public security organs solemnly warn criminals to recognise the situation, stop their crimes before it's too late, and immediately surrender themselves to the authorities to receive lenient treatment."" Last year, US authorities seized about $15bn (£11bn) worth of bitcoin that it alleged belonged to Chen, in what FBI Director Kash Patel described as ""one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history"". The BBC contacted Prince Group for comment at the time. In the past, the Cambodia-based group has denied any involvement in scams. Its website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. Since Chen Zhi was indicted by the US on fraud and money-laundering charges in October, his whereabouts have been unclear. But on Wednesday, the Cambodian authorities said they had ""arrested three Chinese nationals namely Chen Zhi, Xu Ji Liang, and Shao Ji Hui and extradited [them] to the People's Republic of China"". The interior ministry statement did not say where Chen Zhi had been detained. His Cambodian nationality had been revoked by royal decree last month, it added. The enigmatic tycoon had given up his Chinese nationality to become a Cambodian citizen in 2014. The mysterious figure accused of masterminding a $14bn crypto scam Bitcoin worth $14bn seized in US-UK crackdown on alleged scammers Thousands of Chinese lured abroad and forced to be scammers - now Beijing is cracking down The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to South East Asia, many of them to Cambodia, lured by the promise of legitimate jobs and then forced to run online scams. People are held against their will in the scam farms and made to defraud strangers online under the threat of punishment or torture. Many of those trapped are Chinese and targeted people in China. Chinese authorities have also been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020. The company is accused of running online fraud schemes in a number of court cases. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau established a task force to investigate the Prince Group, describing it as ""a major transnational online gambling syndicate based in Cambodia"". Cambodia's ruling elite have been close to Chen Zhi for years. The government has said little since the US and UK sanctioned Prince Group, apart from urging US and UK authorities to be sure they had sufficient evidence for their allegations. By some estimates, scam businesses may account for around half of the entire Cambodian economy.

The community trackers, who discovered 22-year-old Mafuko hugging her newborns on Saturday, said the mother and her two baby sons all appeared to be well and healthy. Twin births are thought to account for about 1% of all mountain gorilla births, though exact data is not widely available. Virunga, situated in a conflict-prone part of DR Congo, is Africa's oldest and largest national park and was set up 100 years ago to protect mountain gorillas of which there are fewer than 1,100 left in the wild. They are only found in the Virunga and in national parks over the border in Rwanda and Uganda, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which compiles a Red List of threatened species. The deadly job of protecting DR Congo's gorillas Gorillas, guns and guerrillas - a deadly mix in an African park The last birth of mountain gorilla twins in Virunga National Park was in September 2020. Mafuko herself gave birth to twins in 2016, but they both died within a week. Young gorillas rely entirely on their mothers for care and transport - and are extremely vulnerable in what can be a dangerous environment where poachers and many armed groups operate. The authorities at the park say additional monitoring and protection measures have been put in place to ensure the twins' survival during this critical period. Rangers would closely observe the young family and provide support if needed, they said. A gorilla's pregnancy lasts for about eight-and-a-half months, and females usually give birth to one infant every four years. According to Virunga conservationists, Mafuko has had a remarkable history of survival herself. Born in 2003 into the Kabirizi family, she lost her mother to armed attackers when she was four years old. She joined the Bageni family when she was 10 - and to date has been pregnant and given birth five times. Conservationists at Virunga, which is a Unesco World Heritage Site, say her latest offspring represent a significant boost for efforts to protect the endangered species. Thanks to anti-poaching patrols and community programmes - supported by the European Union and Unesco - mountain gorilla numbers in Virunga have slowly increased over the past decade. This success, which is documented by the IUCN and other partners, led to their status being upgraded from ""critically endangered"" to ""endangered"" in 2018.

bbc_world,Analysis: Why Trump chose Maduro's VP over Nobel winner,What is it about Delcy Rodríguez that caught the eye of the Trump administration?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77krp7m362o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:20:37 GMT",2026-01-08 04:20:37,"Amid the many questions swirling since last weekend's dramatic events in Caracas – and there are many – one that refuses to go away centres on the bespectacled woman now leading what US officials are calling Venezuela's ""interim authorities"". Why Delcy? What is it about Delcy Rodríguez, daughter of a former Marxist guerilla and deputy to ousted dictator Nicolas Maduro, that has caught the eye of the Trump administration? And why has Washington decided on an avowed ""Chavista"" revolutionary to stay in power, rather than backing the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, whose opposition movement is widely believed to have won the 2024 presidential elections? The answer, according to one former US ambassador to Venezuela, is simple. ""They've gone for stability over democracy,"" says Charles Shapiro, who served as George W Bush's ambassador in Caracas from 2002-04. ""They've kept the dictatorial regime in place without the dictator. The henchmen are still there. ""I think it's risky as hell."" But the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado's opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro. In his dramatic news conference on Saturday morning, US President Donald Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as ""not respected"" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as ""gracious."" ""I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump,"" Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says. ""Her movement was massively elected... and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement."" The speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice-president might have been in on the plan. ""I think it's very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived,"" says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran. ""It's obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself."" But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies. ""Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,"" Gunson says. Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability. In October, an ICG report warned that ""Washington should beware of regime change"". ""The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,"" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities. US seizes two 'shadow fleet' tankers linked to Venezuelan oil Opposition leader Machado says her coalition should lead Venezuela 'I'm a prisoner of war' - In the room for Maduro's dramatic court hearing ""We were warning people in the administration, this is not going to work,"" Gunson says. ""There will be violent chaos, it will be your fault and you'll own it."" On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a classified US intelligence assessment reaching the same conclusions and determining that members of the Maduro regime, including Rodríguez, were in a better position to lead a temporary government. The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future. ""It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration,"" says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas programme at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. But the challenges, he says, have only just begun. ""The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals... are going to take much more time to come to fruition."" For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with. ""She's been a bit of an economic reformer,"" Gunson says. ""She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital."" Ziemer agrees that Rodríguez may not find it difficult to do Washington's bidding when it comes to rolling out the welcome mat for US oil companies, offering greater co-operation on counter-narcotics and even scaling down Venezuela's relations with Cuba, China and Russia, especially if it means the gradual lifting of US sanctions. ""I think she can deliver on that,"" he says. ""But if the US is asking for genuine progress towards a democratic transition, that becomes much harder."" At the moment, this does not appear to be high on Washington's list of priorities. In remarks to the media on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of a three-stage plan for Venezuela, starting with stabilisation of the country and the marketing of 30-50 million barrels of oil under US supervision. The plan would lead to what Rubio called ""a process of reconciliation"", including amnesties for opposition forces, the release of political prisoners and the rebuilding of civil society. ""The third phase, of course, will be one of transition,"" he said, without elaborating. Article 233 of Venezuela's constitution calls for fresh elections within 30 days of a president becoming ""permanently unavailable to serve"" - something that would seem to apply to a situation in which Maduro languishes in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial. But in an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said elections were not on the horizon. ""We have to fix the country first,"" he said. ""You can't have an election."" Gunson says Washington's decision not to go for regime change in the short term might make sense, but the absence of a medium- or long-term prospect is disappointing. ""Trump may be getting something out of this, but Venezuelans aren't,"" he says. ""Ordinary Venezuelans are getting screwed as usual."" With the Trump administration talking up the prospects of international oil companies re-investing in Venezuela's corrupt and moribund petroleum infrastructure, Gunson says the reality may be more complicated. ""Nobody's going to come in here with the tens of billions of dollars that are required... to start the recovery process if the government is illegitimate and there's no rule of law,"" he says. When the former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez designated Maduro as his successor shortly before his death in 2013, the move was described as Chavez's ""dedazo"", a Spanish slang term meaning a ""finger pointing"", a personal anointment which bypasses the normal democratic process. Ambassador Shapiro sees a parallel with the rise to power of Delcy Rodríguez. ""This is Trump's dedazo,"" he says. Trump says 'many' Cuban soldiers killed in Venezuela raid but calls operation 'brilliant' Trump's Venezuela raid has created chaos - and that is a risk for China Trump says Venezuela will be 'turning over' up to 50 million barrels of oil to US","Analysis: Why Trump chose Maduro's VP over Nobel winner Amid the many questions swirling since last weekend's dramatic events in Caracas – and there are many – one that refuses to go away centres on the bespectacled woman now leading what US officials are calling Venezuela's ""interim authorities"".

The answer, according to one former US ambassador to Venezuela, is simple. ""They've gone for stability over democracy,"" says Charles Shapiro, who served as George W Bush's ambassador in Caracas from 2002-04. ""They've kept the dictatorial regime in place without the dictator. The henchmen are still there. ""I think it's risky as hell."" But the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado's opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro. In his dramatic news conference on Saturday morning, US President Donald Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as ""not respected"" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as ""gracious."" ""I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump,"" Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says. ""Her movement was massively elected... and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement."" The speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice-president might have been in on the plan. ""I think it's very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived,"" says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran. ""It's obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself."" But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies. ""Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,"" Gunson says. Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability. In October, an ICG report warned that ""Washington should beware of regime change"". ""The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,"" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities. US seizes two 'shadow fleet' tankers linked to Venezuelan oil Opposition leader Machado says her coalition should lead Venezuela 'I'm a prisoner of war' - In the room for Maduro's dramatic court hearing ""We were warning people in the administration, this is not going to work,"" Gunson says. ""There will be violent chaos, it will be your fault and you'll own it."" On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a classified US intelligence assessment reaching the same conclusions and determining that members of the Maduro regime, including Rodríguez, were in a better position to lead a temporary government. The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future. ""It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration,"" says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas programme at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. But the challenges, he says, have only just begun. ""The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals... are going to take much more time to come to fruition."" For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with. ""She's been a bit of an economic reformer,"" Gunson says. ""She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital."" Ziemer agrees that Rodríguez may not find it difficult to do Washington's bidding when it comes to rolling out the welcome mat for US oil companies, offering greater co-operation on counter-narcotics and even scaling down Venezuela's relations with Cuba, China and Russia, especially if it means the gradual lifting of US sanctions. ""I think she can deliver on that,"" he says. ""But if the US is asking for genuine progress towards a democratic transition, that becomes much harder."" At the moment, this does not appear to be high on Washington's list of priorities. In remarks to the media on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of a three-stage plan for Venezuela, starting with stabilisation of the country and the marketing of 30-50 million barrels of oil under US supervision. The plan would lead to what Rubio called ""a process of reconciliation"", including amnesties for opposition forces, the release of political prisoners and the rebuilding of civil society. ""The third phase, of course, will be one of transition,"" he said, without elaborating. Article 233 of Venezuela's constitution calls for fresh elections within 30 days of a president becoming ""permanently unavailable to serve"" - something that would seem to apply to a situation in which Maduro languishes in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial. But in an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said elections were not on the horizon. ""We have to fix the country first,"" he said. ""You can't have an election."" Gunson says Washington's decision not to go for regime change in the short term might make sense, but the absence of a medium- or long-term prospect is disappointing. ""Trump may be getting something out of this, but Venezuelans aren't,"" he says. ""Ordinary Venezuelans are getting screwed as usual."" With the Trump administration talking up the prospects of international oil companies re-investing in Venezuela's corrupt and moribund petroleum infrastructure, Gunson says the reality may be more complicated. ""Nobody's going to come in here with the tens of billions of dollars that are required... to start the recovery process if the government is illegitimate and there's no rule of law,"" he says. When the former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez designated Maduro as his successor shortly before his death in 2013, the move was described as Chavez's ""dedazo"", a Spanish slang term meaning a ""finger pointing"", a personal anointment which bypasses the normal democratic process. Ambassador Shapiro sees a parallel with the rise to power of Delcy Rodríguez. ""This is Trump's dedazo,"" he says. Trump says 'many' Cuban soldiers killed in Venezuela raid but calls operation 'brilliant' Trump's Venezuela raid has created chaos - and that is a risk for China Trump says Venezuela will be 'turning over' up to 50 million barrels of oil to US",Politics,United States,NEGATIVE,0.7579739093780518
bbc_world,'We are not for sale': Greenlanders express fear and indignation as Trump eyes territory,Greenlanders tell the BBC they have no interest in becoming American as the White House restates its desire for annexation.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgx8w4pgk0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:59:09 GMT",2026-01-07 22:59:09,"""The people of Greenland do not want to become American,"" Mia Chemnitz tells the BBC. ""We are not for sale."" The 32-year-old business owner in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk reflects the sentiments of many who spoke to the BBC about how they felt about recent rhetoric from the Trump administration. The White House has said it was ""actively"" discussing an offer to buy the territory that has for centuries belonged to Denmark. US President Donald Trump and his officials had earlier intimated a willingness to take it by force if necessary. This has been met with nervousness and opprobrium among Greenlanders - both on the world's largest island and elsewhere. This nervousness has only grown since the US took Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro from his residence in Caracas to New York on drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in an unprecedented military move. Almost immediately after, the wife of a senior White House staffer indicated that Greenland was next. ""That's when it stopped feeling abstract,"" says Tupaarnaq Kopeck, 40, who moved to Canada - another place Trump has threatened to annex - for family and work. ""For the first time, I contacted my sister in Greenland and told her that if the unthinkable ever became reality, they would have a place to stay with us."" Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, says the comments from the Trump administration are ""a clear threat"" that she was ""appalled"" by. ""It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,"" she says. Greenland is the world's most sparsely populated territory. With much of the Arctic island covered by ice, most of the population lives in Nuuk and the surrounding south-western coastline. But it is strategically significant to the US - which is why it has had a military presence there since World War Two. Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks. More recently, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. ""It's not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats - if you can call them that - from a giant like the US,"" says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq. ""The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly."" Experts generally agree that a military takeover of Greenland would be an easy undertaking for the US - but that the geopolitical fallout would effectively end the Nato alliance. After the issue of Greenland's ownership was raised anew by the White House, six European allies issued a statement saying its future should be decided by its people - something Mia says she is grateful for. But she worries this will matter little to the US ""if it's not backed with consequences and actions"". ""As a Greenlander, I can't help but wonder: what are we worth to these allies? To what lengths are they willing to go to protect us?"" Tupaarnaq says: ""Respect is about more than alliances on paper. When powerful nations talk about you instead of with you, that respect disappears very quickly."" The Trump administration has stressed its intention was to buy Greenland from Denmark - despite Copenhagen reiterating the territory was not for sale - while retaining a military intervention as an option. Aaja sees annexation by force as unlikely - instead, ""what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time"". Polling consistently shows that Greenlanders generally favour eventual independence from Denmark but oppose being owned by the US. The territory is largely self-governing, with control of foreign affairs and defence retained by Copenhagen. This is perhaps why Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in the remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, seemed unfazed by the prospect of US ownership. ""It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,"" he says. ""We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government."" But he says: ""I don't have time for Trump. Our people are in need,"" explaining hunters like him hunt with dogs on the sea ice and fish, ""but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore"". For Sermitsiaq editor Masaana, the rhetoric from the US is pushing a fallacious binary choice. ""We really have to try to avoid getting the story going to a place where it's Greenland that has to decide between the US and Denmark, because that is not the choice that the Greenlandic people want."" For others, who see the strong relationship Greenland already has with the US being soured, there is a clear sense of indignation. ""People in Greenland are getting really irritated with this,"" says Christian Keldsen of the Greenland Business Association. ""Greenlanders are welcoming and open-hearted, it's the best thing about the country. But now with this, some people are scared."" Greenland is open for business with the US, Christian stresses, noting that there are new direct flights from Greenland to New York - a sure sign ""they don't need to take us over"". ""We are a well-functioning democracy and our government has a strong mandate,"" Mia says. ""We are a Nato ally and the US has had military bases in Greenland for over 70 years - and still has the right to establish and run new and more.

What I am looking at is not just the most powerful computer in the world, but technology pivotal to financial security, Bitcoin, government secrets, the world economy and more. Quantum computing holds the key to which companies and countries win - and lose - the rest of the 21st Century. In front of me suspended a metre in the air, in a Google facility in Santa Barbara California, is Willow. Frankly, it was not what I expected. There are no screens or keyboards, let alone holographic head cams or brain-reading chips. Willow is an oil barrel-sized series of round discs connected by hundreds of black control wires descending into a bronze liquid helium bath refrigerator keeping the quantum microchip a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero. It looks, and feels, very eighties, but if quantum's potential is realised, the metal and wire jellyfish structure in front of me will transform the world, in many ways. ""Welcome to our Quantum AI lab,"" says Hartmut Neven, Google's Quantum AI chief, as we go through the high security door. Neven is something of a legendary figure, part technological genius, part techno music enthusiast, who dresses like he has snowboarded here straight from the Burning Man music festival – for which he designs art. Perhaps he has, in a parallel universe - more on that later. His mission is to turn theoretical physics into functional quantum computers ""to solve otherwise unsolvable problems"" and he admits he's biased but says these chandeliers are the best performing in the world. Secret temple of high science Much of our conversation is about what we are not allowed to film in this restricted lab. This critical technology is subject to export controls, secrecy and is at the heart of a race for commercial and economic supremacy. Any small advantage, from the shape of new components to the companies in global supply chains, is a source of potential leverage. There is a notable Californian vibe in this temple of high science, in its art and colour. Each quantum computer is given a name such as Yakushima or Mendocino, they are each wrapped in a piece of contemporary art, and various graffiti-style murals adorn the walls illuminated by the bright winter sun. Neven holds up Willow, Google's latest quantum chip, which has delivered two important milestones. He said it settled ""once and for all"" the discussion about whether quantum computers can do tasks that classical computers can't. Willow also solved a benchmark problem in minutes that would have taken the best computer in the world 10 septillion years, so more than a trillion trillion, or one with 25 zeros on the end, more than the age of the universe. This theoretical result was recently applied to the Quantum Echoes algorithm, impossible for conventional computers, which helps learn the structure of molecules from the same technology used in MRI machines. Neven reels off the ways he believes this Willow quantum chip will be used ""to help with many problems that humankind has now"". ""It will enable us to discover medicines more efficiently,"" he says. ""It will help us make food production more efficient, it will help us produce energy, to transport energy, to store energy... solve climate change and human hunger."" ""It allows us to understand nature much better, and then unlock its secret to build technologies that make life more pleasant for all of us,"" he tells me. Some researchers believe that actual Artificial Intelligence will only be truly possible with quantum. Members of the team here have just received the Nobel prize for the original research into ""superconducting qubits"" used here. The Willow chip has 105 qubits. Microsoft's quantum effort has 8 qubits , but uses a different approach. The race around the world is to get to 1 million qubits for a ""utility scale machine"" that can do quantum chemistry, drug design, without error. The technology is fragile. What is going on here is being watched carefully around the world. Professor Sir Peter Knight, Chair of the National Quantum Technology Programmes Strategy Advisory Board, says Willow broke new ground. ""All the machines are really still at the toy model stage, they make mistakes. They need error correction. Willow was the first to demonstrate that you could do error correction, through repeated rounds of repairs, which improve,"" he says. This puts the technology on a path to being scaled towards accurately doing a trillion operations, perhaps within seven or eight years, rather than the two decades previously assumed. If the first quarter of this century was defined by the rise of the internet and then Artificial Intelligence, the next 25 years will surely be the start of the quantum era. How does it work? Imagine trying to find a tennis ball in one of a thousand closed drawers. A classical computer opens each one in order. A quantum computer opens all of them at the same time. Or similarly, instead of having to need a hundred keys to open a hundred doors in normal computing, quantum enables you to open all one hundred, with one key, instantly. These machines will not be for everyone. They will not shrink down into phones or AI glasses or laptops. But the point is that the power of these computers grows exponentially, and everyone is getting in on the act. I asked Nvidia chief Jensen Huang whether this poses a threat to his model of providing the specialised chips for AI. ""No, a quantum processor will be added to a computer in the future,"" he replied. And one of the UK's leaders in the field points out what is up for grabs in the quantum world - the eventual power to decrypt almost anything from state secrets to Bitcoin. ""All of cryptocurrency will also have to be re-examined because of the quantum computing threat,"" Sir Peter says. A top partner to Nvidia last year said that while Bitcoin had a few years yet, the technology needed to fork to a stronger blockchain by the end of the decade. Tech industry sources refer to the process of ""Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"" to describe how state agencies are believed to be saving all of the world's encrypted data at home and abroad with the expectation of future generations being able to access it. Global race And then there is the race across the world. China's approach is very different to the commercial race in the US and the West. At around $15bn (£11bn), the total resource committed to quantum technology in China is possibly of the order of all the rest of the world's government programmes put together, says Sir Peter. Since 2022 China has published more scientific papers on quantum than other countries, the efforts have been led by a pioneering physicist called Pan Jianwei. It is a key part of Beijing's 14th five-year plan. China took a decision to stop its tech companies such as Baidu and Alibaba from developing their own quantum research – and concentrate the people and the infrastructure into a state-run enterprise. China is trying to get the edge on quantum communications and satellites. Last year, Pan developed and tested the Zuchongzhi 3.0 quantum computer using similar technology though a different approach to that of Willow, claiming similar results. In the autumn it was opened up for commercial use. It all feels a little like the World War Two Manhattan Project to produce the first nuclear weapons, or the Space Race of the 21st Century. The UK is one of the scientific heartlands for quantum research. It was a British scientist who did the original research on superconducting qubits. There are dozens of companies and cutting-edge research here. The government plans to make a significant investment around this in the coming weeks. It is vital for economics, for military use, and for geopolitics. There is a hope that the UK will be the third power in this area. Parallel universes Back at the Willow lab, there are perhaps even more existential questions being posed. Last year Neven suggested that Willow's unprecedented speed supported some conceptions of the existence of a multiverse. Basically this speed could be explained by Willow having tapped into parallel universes for its compute power. Not all scientists bought this. ""There is still a spirited debate,"" he tells me. ""As you have learned in your lab visit, the reason quantum computers are so powerful is that within one clock cycle it can touch two to the 105 combinations simultaneously. It makes you question where are these different things?… There's a version of quantum mechanics to think about - the many worlds formulation - parallel universes or parallel reality."" Willow had not proved this, Neven was careful to say, but was ""suggestive that we should take this idea seriously"". This is the cutting edge of the frontier of the world, of technology, of growth, and the British government will soon pour hundreds of millions into catching up with Willow and the Chinese. It sounds like science fiction. It is rapidly becoming economic fact.

It is vital for economics, for military use, and for geopolitics. There is a hope that the UK will be the third power in this area. Parallel universes Back at the Willow lab, there are perhaps even more existential questions being posed. Last year Neven suggested that Willow's unprecedented speed supported some conceptions of the existence of a multiverse. Basically this speed could be explained by Willow having tapped into parallel universes for its compute power. Not all scientists bought this. ""There is still a spirited debate,"" he tells me. ""As you have learned in your lab visit, the reason quantum computers are so powerful is that within one clock cycle it can touch two to the 105 combinations simultaneously. It makes you question where are these different things?… There's a version of quantum mechanics to think about - the many worlds formulation - parallel universes or parallel reality."" Willow had not proved this, Neven was careful to say, but was ""suggestive that we should take this idea seriously"". This is the cutting edge of the frontier of the world, of technology, of growth, and the British government will soon pour hundreds of millions into catching up with Willow and the Chinese. It sounds like science fiction. It is rapidly becoming economic fact.

bbc_world,How tariff disruption will continue reshaping the global economy in 2026,Trump's import levies are still changing the patterns of international trade.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czejp3gep63o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:40 GMT",2026-01-08 00:00:40,"President Trump's favourite word is tariffs. He reminded the world of that in his pre-Christmas ""address to the nation"". With the world still unwrapping the tariffs ""gift"" from the first year of his second term in office, he said they were bringing jobs, higher wages and economic growth to the US. That is hotly contested. What is less debatable is that they've refashioned the global economy, and will continue to do so into 2026. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that although ""the tariff shock is smaller than originally announced"", it is a key reason why it now expects the rate of global economic growth to slow to 3.1% in 2026. A year ago, it predicted a 3.3% expansion this year. For the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, things are ""better than we feared, worse than it needs to be"". Speaking on a podcast recently she explained that growth had fallen from a pre-Covid average of 3.7%. ""This growth is too slow to meet the aspirations of people around the world for better lives,"" she said. Other forecasts for 2026 are even more pessimistic than that of the IMF. Trump says he will visit China in April after call with Xi US economy grows at fastest pace in two years Yet the impact of the tariffs on the global economy was not as bad as it could have been, notes Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who is also a former chief economist at the IMF. He says this is the case because ""countries didn't retaliate strongly against the US"". Obstfeld adds: ""And the one country that did forcefully hit back, which is China, induced the US to back down very quickly. So we certainly avoided a trade disaster."" However, after five rounds of trade talks, the world's two biggest economies still have more tariffs and other trade restrictions in place against each other than when Trump took office for the second time. The tariffs have pushed up costs for many businesses and increased uncertainty, which makes it harder to plan for and invest in the future. Despite the resilience seen so far, ""these frictions and uncertainties take their toll over time"", such as through efficiency loses, according to Obstfeld. Some of the damage of tariffs has been mitigated by lower interest rates, a fall in the value of the dollar, businesses finding clever ways around them, and, crucially, the many exemptions they contain. This may help explain why the UN trade agency UNCTAD is forecasting that the value of global trade grew 7% last year to reach more than $35tn (£26tn). Yet Obstfeld says the loopholes in US tariffs are a double-edged sword. ""The exemptions mean lower tariffs in practice, but they also introduce a lot of uncertainty about how you get them."" Countries including the UK, South Korea and Japan have managed to navigate those mysteries and agree trade deals with Trump. Others will hope they can do so during 2026. Whilst some economists have expressed doubt about how strongly the US is now growing, between July and September it expanded by 4.3%, the strongest annual growth in two years. ""This is a very, very resilient economy, and I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,"" says Aditya Bhave, a senior economist at Bank of America. He thinks tariffs have added between 0.3% and 0.5% to US inflation, which in November was 2.7%, but ""we probably haven't seen the full impact"" yet.  That matters given the US economy is driven by consumer spending, and that it accounts for 26% of the global economy, according to the IMF. Cost of living pressures are still a problem for people in many parts of the world, but there are some encouraging signs for them. In the eurozone, inflation has stabilised and is now running at 2.1%. But in the UK it's 3.2%, which as in the US, remains well above the central banks' 2% target. Others major influences on the global economy this year could include the renegotiation of the US Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal that Trump signed in his first term in office. Meanwhile, EU member states are due to vote on whether to ratify a South American trade deal that was signed more than a year ago. And back in the US, there is a lot riding on a Supreme Court decision on the legality of Trump's tariffs. One key input into the world economy is oil, and Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs expects the price of benchmark Brent Crude to fall around 8% this year to around $56 a barrel. That forecast is based on strong production in the US and Russia, rather than Trump's intervention in Venezuela, which is unlikely to lead to more oil on global markets in the short term. With oil used for energy and transport, another downward pressure on prices could be the resumption of global shipping through the Red Sea. A week before Christmas shipping giant Maersk sent a container ship through it for the first time in almost two years. Attacks by Houthi rebels based in Yemen, that were linked to the war in Gaza, mean major shipping companies have avoided it. Instead they've taken the longer and more expensive route around southern Africa. Maersk says that whilst it was ""a significant step forward, we are not at a point where we can set a date on any potential wider network change back to the trans-Suez corridor"". One of the most important destinations for container ships is China. It's where they pick up the toys, electronics, clothing and other goods that the country makes for the rest of the world. However, Beijing's trade relations with the US continue to cast a shadow over the global economy. The latest available data suggests the value of goods the world's two biggest economies sold each other fell for the third consecutive year in 2025. Unlike a year ago, there wasn't even a nod towards those strains, or the many domestic economic pressures in President Xi's 2026 new year message. However, he did forecast the world's second-biggest economy would reach the landmark size of $20tn this year, and said that China is ""ready to work with all countries to advance world peace and development"". Tariffs, US sourcing of rare earth metals, and Chinese access to high-end US computer chips, have dominated talks between the two sides, but there are many other issues to be resolved when Xi hosts Trump in April, according to James Zimmerman who chairs the American Chamber of Commerce in China. ""A lot is riding on that [meeting],"" he says. ""Our expectations are indeed low."" But he adds that its ""very, very important"" that there is a sustained dialogue even if it takes time to deliver results. ""Beijing wants a fair shake at being able to compete globally. They do feel that the environment in certain places has been very restrictive towards Chinese companies. Part of that is the over emphasis on security concerns."" On the other side, Zimmerman says that US concerns include ""how China manages its manufacturing output"". ""Overcapacity is an issue that is affecting a lot of different economies."" He explains that China has shown its strength in manufacturing consumer goods, but that it needs to show it can make adjustments when demand for them falls, ""so that there is not a situation where you have massive dumping of consumer goods around the world"". In Europe, the continent's reliance on cheap Chinese imports is growing, according to research from Dutch bank ING. This is something that the EU is looking to crack down on in the coming months. Back in the US, limiting the inflow of foreign-made goods is a key part of Trump's trade policy. His Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently wrote that re-industrialisation and increasing ""manufacturing's share of our economy"" was in the US national interest. In a hint towards tariffs staying in place, he argued that new investments in making cars, ships and pharmaceuticals in the US wouldn't be happening without them. However, since Trump's second term began, the number of Americans in manufacturing jobs has fallen slightly to just under 12.7 million. Obstfeld says that despite tariffs the US economy has continued to grow because of ""resilient consumers who want to spend their money anyway"", and the huge investment in AI that has sent stock markets to record highs. With some of Trump's key policy aims, such as creating new manufacturing jobs, still to be achieved Obstfeld adds: ""I don't think tariffs are going to go away as a matter of policy or of discussion.""

China is ramping up economic and political pressure on Japan, announcing on Tuesday a ban on exports of equipment with dual military and civilian applications , including items that use rare earth elements. Beijing followed up the next day by launching an anti-dumping investigation into a Japanese compound used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. The measures come shortly after Beijing canceled a visit by Japanese business leaders, which had been scheduled for this month. China also put pressure on domestic travel agencies to cancel trips to Japan , resulting in millions of Chinese booking alternative destinations over the coming months. The row between Beijing and China is continuing to escalate two months after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi responded to a question in the Japanese parliament by saying that a ""contingency"" around Taiwan — broadly understood to mean a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island — could constitute a threat to Japan's national security and necessitate a military response . Beijing — which views Taiwan as a Chinese province and vows to reunify it with the mainland, even by force if necessary — insists that Takaichi's comments are unwanted interference in a domestic issue.

Worryingly, analysts point out that neither side appears able to back down in the confrontation and that bilateral relations may well get worse before an off-ramp can be found. ""The chances of either side de-escalating the situation at the moment appear quite low because neither wants to lose face,"" said Ben Ascione, an assistant professor of politics and international relations at Tokyo's Waseda University. ""Prime Minister Takaichi is showing no signs of backing down on her Taiwan comments, while Xi has strong domestic reasons not to back down,"" he told DW. This means that President Xi Jinping might look for yet more ways to compel Tokyo to back down if Beijing's latest round of pressure does not have the desired effect. China and Japan have long been at loggerheads over a wide range of issues, ranging from imperial Japan's vicious invasion in the 1930s and its often brutal treatment of Chinese people to differing interpretations of the two nations' shared history, territorial disputes and military confrontations. Geopolitical rivalry now defines the bilateral relationship amid China's growing economic might and military assertiveness. 'Absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable' In the weeks immediately after Takaichi's comments about Taiwan, Japan said Chinese military aircraft locked their radar onto Japanese jets monitoring naval exercises off the coast of Okinawa Prefecture. And, in late December, Chinese troops carried out air and maritime exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan. Japan has protested what it says is overly aggressive maneuvers by China in the region, including Beijing's repeated claims of sovereignty over the uninhabited Senkaku Islands, which Beijing refers to as the Diaoyu archipelago. China shows off military might in massive parade To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The announcement by China's Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday involved banning exports of dual-use civilian and military equipment to Japan, including sensors, semiconductors, batteries and chemicals, as well as components for equipment. The export controls went into effect immediately, the ministry said. The ban was imposed despite Takaichi striking a conciliatory note on Monday. ""We are open to dialogue with China and have not closed the door,"" she told reporters at a press conference marking the new year. ""We maintain the policy of pursuing a comprehensive, strategic, mutually beneficial relationship to build a constructive relationship with China."" Responding to the export ban, however, the Japanese government lodged an official protest on Wednesday, saying Beijing's actions were ""absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable"" as they only target Japan and ""deviate significantly"" from international practice. In Beijing, a government spokeswoman said China's actions are in accordance with laws and regulations, dismissing requests from Japan that the export ban be lifted. Who has the upper hand? Also on Wednesdy, China doubled down by opening an anti-dumping investigation into imports of dichlorosilane from Japan. The chemical compound is used primarily in thin-film deposition processes in chip manufacturing, making it very important for companies producing integrated circuits. Beijing claims that imports of the precursor chemical from Japan have risen since 2022 while prices have fallen by 31%, damaging domestic Chinese manufacturers. The restrictions have rattled Japanese businesses, with the Tokyo Stock Exchange down broadly for a second day on Thursday and Ken Kobayashi, the chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, stating at an event this week that efforts need to be made on both sides to deepen dialogue and enhance a ""mutually beneficial relationship."" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of politics and international relations at Waseda University, believes that China holds the upper hand. ""China can exert a lot of pressure on Japanese companies, which are quite quickly going to find themselves in a difficult situation,"" he said. ""If Beijing really is halting exports of rare earths, that will cause turmoil."" Shigemura pointed out that Chinese leader Xi attempted to win the support of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung for an anti-Japanese alliance during the latter's visit to China this week, although the Korean leader remained non-committal. Seoul is undoubtedly watching developments with concern, he added. For nearly a decade, Beijing is also exerting pressure on South Korea with an undeclared ban on its music, movies and live performances, introduced after the US stationed Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile systems in South Korea in 2017.

""This is not a trade issue for China; it is a political issue,"" he said. ""Beijing sees Takaichi as being too conservative and they want her out of office. China wants to make life difficult for her and to see her replaced at the next election and for a new government that is more open to Beijing."" Ascione believes that Takaichi made a strategic error by needlessly stating out loud a policy that has previously only been tacitly held in Tokyo and eliminating diplomatic wiggle room on Taiwan created by previous Japanese governments.  The challenge will be to find a way out of the current situation, he said. ""Japanese diplomats will be thinking about how they might be able to de-escalate the situation, which is very difficult if Takaichi will not retract her comments,"" he said. ""Neither side appears willing to blink at this point and it will take time for the anger and frustration to subside to the point that moves can be made to patch up the relationship,"" the expert added.

dw_world,Uganda's debt crisis deepens ahead of elections,"With debt at record highs and new loans approved, Uganda faces growing pressure. Economists warn the strategy may backfire on future growth.",https://www.dw.com/en/uganda-s-debt-crisis-deepens-ahead-of-elections/a-75399953?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf,2026-01-08T13:29:00Z,2026-01-08 13:29:00+00:00,"With debt at record highs and new loans approved, Uganda faces growing pressure. Economists warn the strategy may backfire on future growth. Uganda's national debt stands at $32.3 billion (€27.5 billion), with the government recently approving a loan of 9 trillion Ugandan shillings ($2.5 billion, €2.1 billion), fueling concern over the country's spiraling finances. For many Ugandans, the direct impact of this borrowing is invisible because the promised benefits never seem to materialize. But for economist Steven Alor, the public is paying a heavy price for the government's fiscal indiscipline. He explains that potential consequences include unbuilt roads, neglected health facilities and unfinished or delayed infrastructure projects. ""The government is always saying the debt-to-GDP is sustainable. It is just about 51% of the of the GDP, which is really not that sustainable,"" Alor told DW. ""Borrowing is not bad if the money is put into good use. But we're seeing time and time again, money has not been put into good use."" Efforts to trim debt The Ugandan government has publicly attempted to reduce domestic debt. In December, Reuters news agency reported Ugandan plans to cut domestic debt issuance by 21.1% in the financial year starting in July. The 9 trillion shillings will be issued in the 2026-2027 financial year, down from 11.4 trillion shillings worth of debt issued in 2025-2026. According to Reuters, the ministry said this was to ""avoid crowding out of the private sector, curb the rising debt-to-GDP ratio, and address the growing burden of interest payments relative to revenues."" Alor said there have been examples where government borrowing has been effective, such as during the COVID pandemic . ""A lot of money was generated from the public. But the public can only give you that if they know the money is not going to go into someone's pocket,"" he said. ""You cannot borrow forever."" Jacob Nuwa, a Kampala resident, said that Ugandans know money has been lost ""under the guise of money borrowed to improve service delivery."" ""If you go and look at the individuals who are supposed to do this work, their bank balances are fattening, their assets are increasing, and somehow they're living large,"" he told DW. Massive debt servicing grows burden on public Ramathan Mudde, a retired economics lecturer from Kampala International University, told DW that while borrowing in itself was not bad, ""selfish interests"" were causing financial problems for the future. ""When you look at these MPs, they will always approve money to be borrowed. Why? Because they know they are beneficiaries in one way or the other,"" Mudde told DW. ""If there are no reforms, Parliament will keep on approving, and government will keep on abusing it,"" Mudde added. Servicing Uganda's public debt could eat almost a third of all domestic revenues in the 2026-2027 fiscal year, according to the Ugandan Ministry of Finance. Debt is expensive, too — domestic borrowing, for instance, comes with 15%-17% interest rates. The ministry acknowledged public debt rose to 51% in June 2025, as a percentage of gross domestic product. Lawrence Kooko, a Kampala-based business reporter, told DW: ""We are now having a debt of more than 100 trillion shillings out there in borrowing. So where have they put the money?

Economists warn the strategy may backfire on future growth. Uganda's national debt stands at $32.3 billion (€27.5 billion), with the government recently approving a loan of 9 trillion Ugandan shillings ($2.5 billion, €2.1 billion), fueling concern over the country's spiraling finances. For many Ugandans, the direct impact of this borrowing is invisible because the promised benefits never seem to materialize. But for economist Steven Alor, the public is paying a heavy price for the government's fiscal indiscipline. He explains that potential consequences include unbuilt roads, neglected health facilities and unfinished or delayed infrastructure projects. ""The government is always saying the debt-to-GDP is sustainable. It is just about 51% of the of the GDP, which is really not that sustainable,"" Alor told DW. ""Borrowing is not bad if the money is put into good use. But we're seeing time and time again, money has not been put into good use."" Efforts to trim debt The Ugandan government has publicly attempted to reduce domestic debt. In December, Reuters news agency reported Ugandan plans to cut domestic debt issuance by 21.1% in the financial year starting in July. The 9 trillion shillings will be issued in the 2026-2027 financial year, down from 11.4 trillion shillings worth of debt issued in 2025-2026. According to Reuters, the ministry said this was to ""avoid crowding out of the private sector, curb the rising debt-to-GDP ratio, and address the growing burden of interest payments relative to revenues."" Alor said there have been examples where government borrowing has been effective, such as during the COVID pandemic . ""A lot of money was generated from the public. But the public can only give you that if they know the money is not going to go into someone's pocket,"" he said. ""You cannot borrow forever."" Jacob Nuwa, a Kampala resident, said that Ugandans know money has been lost ""under the guise of money borrowed to improve service delivery."" ""If you go and look at the individuals who are supposed to do this work, their bank balances are fattening, their assets are increasing, and somehow they're living large,"" he told DW. Massive debt servicing grows burden on public Ramathan Mudde, a retired economics lecturer from Kampala International University, told DW that while borrowing in itself was not bad, ""selfish interests"" were causing financial problems for the future. ""When you look at these MPs, they will always approve money to be borrowed. Why? Because they know they are beneficiaries in one way or the other,"" Mudde told DW. ""If there are no reforms, Parliament will keep on approving, and government will keep on abusing it,"" Mudde added. Servicing Uganda's public debt could eat almost a third of all domestic revenues in the 2026-2027 fiscal year, according to the Ugandan Ministry of Finance. Debt is expensive, too — domestic borrowing, for instance, comes with 15%-17% interest rates. The ministry acknowledged public debt rose to 51% in June 2025, as a percentage of gross domestic product. Lawrence Kooko, a Kampala-based business reporter, told DW: ""We are now having a debt of more than 100 trillion shillings out there in borrowing. So where have they put the money? We cannot go on borrowing more money that we can't account for."" Kooko added that while the public was not fully benefiting from government borrowing, it would be ""the local person who pays the tax, who in the end term pays back these loans to these big people, to these big borrowers.""

Some farmers fear they will be undercut with cheaper goods from South America. Farmers in France blocked roads into Paris on Thursday as they protested against the Mercosur trade deal the European Union hopes to ink with South American countries . Scores of tractors were driven into the capital before dawn with a number managing to get through to the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. The farmers managed to overrun checkpoints and entered the city while being swarmed by police. The French government said it would ""not stand by"" and allow ""illegal"" actions. Government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon told France Info Radio that blocking a motorway or ""attempting to gather in front of the National Assembly with all the symbolism that this entails is once again illegal,"" adding the government ""will not allow it."" Why are farmers protesting? The protest — largely-led by the Coordination Rurale union — takes place amid fears that the planned free trade deal with the South American Mercosur bloc could flood European markets with cheaper imports. ""We are between resentment and despair. We have a feeling of abandonment, with Mercosur being an example,"" Stephane Pelletier — a senior member of the Coordination Rurale union — told the Reuters news agency beneath the Eiffel Tower. ""We said we'd come up to Paris — here we are,"" said Ludovic Ducloux, co-head of one of the union's chapters. One of them bore the message ""No To Mercosur"", referring to the deal with four South American nations. Aside from the trade deal, farmers are also upset over a government decision to cull cows in response to the spread of nodular dermatitis — a bovine sickness widely known as lumpy skin disease. German farmers also demonstrating German farmers were took to the country's highways over the Mercosur deal, parking up tractors at motorway junctions in parts of the country. German news program Tagesschau reported that farmers had blocked motorway entrances to the A4 in Thuringia and the A9 in Saxony-Anhalt. Demonstrations were also expected in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg. What is the Mercosur deal? The free trade deal aims to bolster trade between the South American and European economic blocs, but is viewed critically by a number of EU member states. Those backing the agreement include Germany, Spain and Nordic countries who argue that it increases exports currently suffering under US tariffs and reduces reliance on Beijing. However, critics including France, Italy and Poland are wary of an influx of cheap commodities and its impact on European farmers. Farmers in Belgium staged mass protests against the trade deal in December when they rolled hundreds of tractors into Brussels. EU member states are expected to vote on the trade accord on Friday, with the deal piling pressure on President Emmanuel Macron and his centrist Ensemble coalition, which does not hold a majority in parliament.

The Trump administration has never made any secret of the fact that it considers left-wing governments in South America a problem and the continent the United States' backyard. With regard to Colombia, the strategy could be to simply play for time and hope for a victory for the ultra-right-wing candidate Abelardo de la Espriella, who is believed to be friendly to the US, in the presidential election in May — although the left-wing candidate Ivan Cepeda is ahead in all polls.

""No, gentlemen imperialists, this is not your 'backyard'… We do not recognize the Monroe Doctrine, nor the kings or emperors above us,"" he said. ""For the sake of Venezuela, as well as for the sake of Cuba, we are ready to give even our blood, even our life, but we will not back down.

But for Cuba expert Bert Hoffmann, Cuba is the biggest loser following the US military strike in Venezuela.

Even now, everyday life for Cubans is difficult: There are hourslong power outages, a daily struggle for food, medicine and fuel, and a futile wait for visitors following a massive slump in the country's most important source of income, tourism. The Cuban government is now trying to find replacements for oil supplies from Venezuela, and according to Hoffmann, is looking to Russia, Arab states, Iran or Algeria. ""The most likely scenario is that the political leadership will make every effort to keep the ranks so tightly closed that the dissatisfaction of the population will ultimately find no political expression,"" Hoffmann told DW. So far, the power apparatus in Cuba appears to have maintained great unity. ""The Communist Party, the military, and the security apparatus are closely intertwined,"" said Hoffmann. ""As long as no cracks appear there, this elite will remain relatively firmly in the saddle."" He also said he believes Cuba cannot hope for significant assistance from Russia and China — there will be some support, but not to the extent of open confrontation with the United States. Hoffmann does not believe the US will intervene militarily in the immediate future.

""I don't believe in an invasion; I don't even think it's something they're taking very seriously,"" Sheinbaum said. ""It is necessary to reaffirm that in Mexico the people rule, and that we are a free and sovereign country — cooperation, yes; subordination and intervention, no.""

Japan has criticized new Chinese restrictions on exporting so-called dual-use goods to the country, imposed after comments from its prime minister on Chinese military drills near Taiwan upset Beijing. ""A measure such as this, targeting only our country, differs significantly from international practice, is absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable,"" Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara saidd. Dual use items are goods, software or technologies that can have both civilian and military applications, and can include certain key rare earths used to make items like drones and computer chips. China meanwhile followed up on Tuesday's restriction by announcing an investigation into imported dichlorosilane, a chemical gas used in making seminconductors. It said this followed an application from its domestic industry, which had complained that prices for the chemical imported from Japan had fallen by 31% between 2022 and 2024. ""The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,"" China's Commerce Ministry alleged on Wednesday. State-aligned media on Wednesday cited sources as saying that Beijing was also considering further restrictions on crucial rare earth minerals, but China's government has not made any official statements in this direction. Japan's Foreign Ministry has also criticized the restrictions, along with the prime minister's spokesman Kihara, but Tokyo has not as yet announced any reciprocal measures against China.

To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Taiwan comments from new government in Tokyo rile Beijing China has been showing mounting displeasure with comments from Japan's government and individual politicians pertaining to Taiwan . On November 7, less than a month after taking office, Japanese Prime Minsiter Sanae Takaichi had suggested in comments to parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would constitute an existential threat to Japan. She even implied that Japan's military could potentially mobilize in support of the US, if it were to take steps to try to protect the administration in Taipei. Japan is also increasing its defense spending and redefining its military's mandate, after decades of it being defined as a purely defensive force since defeat in World War II. China, which considers the island rightfully part of its territory, has been pressing Takaichi to retract the comments . Japan's first female prime minister has not done so, but did say on Monday that her government was ""open to various opportunities for dialogue with China and has never closed the door."" The tensions were further stoked on Tuesday when Japanese lawmaker Hei Seki, who was sanctioned by China last year for ""spreading fallacies"" about Taiwan and other disputed territories, visited Taipei and called Taiwan an independent country. He said he had made the visit to show that China and Taiwan were ""different countries."" ""The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said on Wednesday when asked to comment on Seki's visit. Japan — like the US, Germany, and many countries in the West — walks the fine line of formally adhering to the ""One China"" principle, not recognizing Taiwan as a country, while simultaneously providing support to the island democracy and trying to dissuade Beijing from any efforts to change the status quo by force. Tension contrasts with South Korea overtures and state visit China's new restrictions on Japan also coincide with the first state visit by a South Korean president since the COVID pandemic. President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip on Wednesday.

Japan has criticized new Chinese restrictions on exporting so-called dual-use goods to the country, imposed after comments from its prime minister on Chinese military drills near Taiwan upset Beijing. ""A measure such as this, targeting only our country, differs significantly from international practice, is absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable,"" Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara saidd. Dual use items are goods, software or technologies that can have both civilian and military applications, and can include certain key rare earths used to make items like drones and computer chips. China meanwhile followed up on Tuesday's restriction by announcing an investigation into imported dichlorosilane, a chemical gas used in making seminconductors. It said this followed an application from its domestic industry, which had complained that prices for the chemical imported from Japan had fallen by 31% between 2022 and 2024. ""The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,"" China's Commerce Ministry alleged on Wednesday. State-aligned media on Wednesday cited sources as saying that Beijing was also considering further restrictions on crucial rare earth minerals, but China's government has not made any official statements in this direction. Japan's Foreign Ministry has also criticized the restrictions, along with the prime minister's spokesman Kihara, but Tokyo has not as yet announced any reciprocal measures against China.

On November 7, less than a month after taking office, Japanese Prime Minsiter Sanae Takaichi had suggested in comments to parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would constitute an existential threat to Japan. She even implied that Japan's military could potentially mobilize in support of the US, if it were to take steps to try to protect the administration in Taipei. Japan is also increasing its defense spending and redefining its military's mandate, after decades of it being defined as a purely defensive force since defeat in World War II. China, which considers the island rightfully part of its territory, has been pressing Takaichi to retract the comments . Japan's first female prime minister has not done so, but did say on Monday that her government was ""open to various opportunities for dialogue with China and has never closed the door."" The tensions were further stoked on Tuesday when Japanese lawmaker Hei Seki, who was sanctioned by China last year for ""spreading fallacies"" about Taiwan and other disputed territories, visited Taipei and called Taiwan an independent country. He said he had made the visit to show that China and Taiwan were ""different countries."" ""The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said on Wednesday when asked to comment on Seki's visit. Japan — like the US, Germany, and many countries in the West — walks the fine line of formally adhering to the ""One China"" principle, not recognizing Taiwan as a country, while simultaneously providing support to the island democracy and trying to dissuade Beijing from any efforts to change the status quo by force. Tension contrasts with South Korea overtures and state visit China's new restrictions on Japan also coincide with the first state visit by a South Korean president since the COVID pandemic. President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip on Wednesday. He and Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw the signing of several cooperation agreements in areas like technology, trade, transportation and environemental protection.

The US military's pre-dawn attack in Venezuela on Saturday and the capture of authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, over alleged drug offenses prompted a swift response from the African Union . The bloc expressed ""grave concern"" and called for respect for sovereignty of states and their territorial integrity. ""The African Union calls upon all parties concerned to exercise restraint, responsibility and respect for international law to prevent any escalation and to preserve regional peace and stability,"" it said in a statement on the situation in Venezuela . Maduro: A disputed president The United States does not regard Maduro as a legitimate president. Like the EU and many Latin American states, it questions the official result of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election , which was accompanied by allegations of fraud .

Dodd noted that some governments in Africa likely have a vested interest in not undermining their relationship with the US. ""The question of potential US retaliation down the line in response to criticism of US action in Venezuela is probably driving the fact of many African governments being quiet,"" he said. 'Complete violation of international law' South Africa , which Trump has accused of alleged discrimination — and even "" genocide "" — of minority white Afrikaners, called the US military actions a grave violation of international law.

In the aftermath of the strikes, Donald Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that “ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria , who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians” were hit with “numerous perfect strikes”. The operation, coordinated with Nigeria, targeted an Islamist group known as Lakurawa, which extorts the mainly Muslim local population and enforces a strict version of sharia law that includes lashes for listening to music. Very little information has been shared by either the US or Nigeria about the strikes’ impact and it is unclear how many Lakurawa fighters, if any, died. The US Africa Command branch of the US military said on 25 December that its “initial assessment is that multiple Isis terrorists were killed in the Isis camps”. Malik Samuel, a researcher with Good Governance Africa , said he had spoken to a Lakurawa member who said about 100 fighters were killed in a forest camp in the Tangaza area of Sokoto state. He said he was told that about 200 were missing, with many of the remaining fighters now trying to cross into Niger. This could not be independently confirmed. Residents of Nukuru, a village about 6 miles from the reported camp, told the BBC that fighters on about 15 motorcycles had fled through the community, riding three to a bike. Missile debris fell on empty farmland about 60 miles south in the town of Jabo, which local people said had never been attacked by Lakurawa. Debris also reportedly damaged a hotel 500 miles south of Tangaza, injuring three workers. It remains unclear why the US specifically targeted Lakurawa, which operates in a rural, underdeveloped and almost entirely Muslim area in the north-west near the Niger border. Most violence in the area is perpetrated by armed gangs known as bandits. Trump had previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to stop the killing of Christians, an important theme for his evangelical base. Two US officials told the New York Times that the airstrikes were a one-off aimed at allowing Trump to claim he was going after a group that had killed Christians. Murtala Abdullahi, a Nigerian security consultant, also said Lakurawa was probably a symbolic target. “How do you establish a link that [a] bandit group has been hitting the Christian community?” he asked. “That’s difficult. But if you hit a jihadist group then you don’t need to establish a link.” Abdullahi said he did not know why the US had chosen to hit Lakurawa rather than Boko Haram, which is far more notorious internationally and attacks both Christians and Muslims. Since the airstrikes, global attention around Trump’s unpredictable, militarised foreign policy has turned to Venezuela, where US forces abducted Nicolás Maduro on 3 January, and Greenland, where Trump and other senior US officials have expressed renewed interest in a US takeover. Very little is known conclusively about Lakurawa, from the year it started to the number of fighters. Even the meaning of its name, which some analysts say is a Hausa pronunciation of “ les recrues ” (“the recruits” in French), is not an agreed fact. Nigeria designated the group as a terrorist organisation in January 2025. Some analysts say the group is linked to Islamic State’s Sahel branch. However, Samuel said he had interviewed Lakurawa members who professed loyalty to al-Qaida. Researchers agree that the group’s senior members are from Mali or Nigeria. Local people in Sokoto state report that fighters speak Hausa with a foreign accent and a different language among themselves. In about 2017, Lakurawa was invited by some local communities to protect them against bandits. However, the group has since turned to violent methods similar to those of the bandits, as well as enforcing their extreme version of Islam. “That coercive authority that they started asserting turned communities against them,” said Kato Van Broeckhoven, a United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research researcher. Even before the US intervention, military action alone had failed to quell Nigeria’s numerous, proliferating security crises. Just last week, gunmen killed more than 30 people in Niger state, in the centre-west of Nigeria, and abducted an unknown number of people. Local people told reporters they included students from a Catholic school where 300 pupils and teachers were kidnapped in November and only freed in December . “Why is Nigeria a fertile ground for all these groups to come in and operate?” Samuel said. “It is simple: because of governance issues … You see clearly the level of poverty in these places, you see clearly the absence of the state, the vacuum that has been created.” Nigeria Islamic State Trump administration US foreign policy Africa news","Two weeks on, questions linger over targeting and impact of US airstrikes in Nigeria Very little information has been shared about strikes in Sokoto state Two weeks after the US carried out Christmas Day airstrikes in north-west Nigeria on what it described as Islamic State fighters, questions remain over the specific group that was targeted and the operation’s impact.

Researchers say the pyre, discovered in a rock shelter at the foot of Mount Hora in northern Malawi , is thought to be the oldest in the world to contain adult remains, the oldest confirmed intentional cremation in Africa, and the first pyre to be associated with African hunter-gatherers. In total 170 individual human bone fragments – apparently from an adult woman just under 1.5 metres (5ft) tall – were discovered in two clusters during excavations in 2017 and 2018, with layers of ash, charcoal and sediment. However, the woman’s skull was missing, while cut marks suggest some bones were separated at the joints, and flesh was removed, before the body was burned. “There is no evidence to suggest that they were doing any kind of violent act or cannibalism to the remains,” said Dr Jessica Cerezo-Román of the University of Oklahoma, who led the study. Instead, she said, body parts might have been removed as part of a funerary ritual, perhaps to be carried as tokens. Dr Jessica Thompson, a senior author of the study from Yale University, said that, while such practices may not seem relatable, people still keep locks of hair or relatives’ ashes for scattering in a meaningful place. The researchers said the rock shelter appears to have been used as a natural monument, with burials occurring from about 16,000 to 8,000 years ago. As well as complete skeletons, very small collections of bones from different individuals have been found. “[This] supports our hypothesis that some of the missing bones from the cremated woman may have been deliberately removed and taken as tokens for curation or reburial elsewhere,” said Dr Ebeth Sawchuk, a co-author of the study from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. The team also found flakes and points from stone-knapping within the pyre, which might have been added as part of a funeral ritual. “Were people actively throwing these things into the fire or … were they in the body itself?” said Thompson. Cerezo-Román said one possibility is that people were knapping stones to cut the woman’s flesh. The team also found the pyre was about the size of a queen-sized mattress, and would have taken considerable knowledge, skill and coordination to build and maintain, while the two clusters of bones indicate the body was moved during cremation. While it is unclear why the woman was given such special treatment, the team found at least one fire was subsequently made directly above the location of the pyre – possibly as an act of remembrance. However, the site also has evidence of multiple campfires, with Thompson noting it is likely the shelter would also have been used for daily life. Writing in the journal Science Advances , the team note the oldest known pyre containing human remains was previously found in Alaska, and dates to about 11,500 years ago – however, that was for a young child. Indeed, most burned human remains dating back 8,000 years or more have not been found in a pyre, and prior to the latest find the earliest confirmed intentional cremations in Africa only appeared about 3,500 years ago, among pastoral Neolithic people . Thompson said the discovery that different people merited different treatment in death “suggests that in life, they also would have had a lot more complexity to their social roles than I ever imagined, or that certainly is stereotypically described for tropical hunter-gatherers, especially this old”. Joel Irish, a professor of anthropology and archaeology at Liverpool John Moores University, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the discovery. “That it is such an early date, and that they would have been transient as hunter-gatherers makes it more amazing,” he said. “They clearly had advanced belief systems and a high level of social complexity at this early date.” Anthropology Archaeology Africa Malawi news","Cremation pyre in Africa thought to be world’s oldest containing adult remains 9,500-year-old pyre uncovered in Malawi offers rare insight into rituals of ancient African hunter-gatherer groups A cremation pyre built about 9,500 years ago has been discovered in Africa , offering a fresh glimpse into the complexity of ancient hunter-gatherer communities.

Cerezo-Román said one possibility is that people were knapping stones to cut the woman’s flesh. The team also found the pyre was about the size of a queen-sized mattress, and would have taken considerable knowledge, skill and coordination to build and maintain, while the two clusters of bones indicate the body was moved during cremation. While it is unclear why the woman was given such special treatment, the team found at least one fire was subsequently made directly above the location of the pyre – possibly as an act of remembrance. However, the site also has evidence of multiple campfires, with Thompson noting it is likely the shelter would also have been used for daily life. Writing in the journal Science Advances , the team note the oldest known pyre containing human remains was previously found in Alaska, and dates to about 11,500 years ago – however, that was for a young child. Indeed, most burned human remains dating back 8,000 years or more have not been found in a pyre, and prior to the latest find the earliest confirmed intentional cremations in Africa only appeared about 3,500 years ago, among pastoral Neolithic people . Thompson said the discovery that different people merited different treatment in death “suggests that in life, they also would have had a lot more complexity to their social roles than I ever imagined, or that certainly is stereotypically described for tropical hunter-gatherers, especially this old”. Joel Irish, a professor of anthropology and archaeology at Liverpool John Moores University, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the discovery. “That it is such an early date, and that they would have been transient as hunter-gatherers makes it more amazing,” he said. “They clearly had advanced belief systems and a high level of social complexity at this early date.” Anthropology Archaeology Africa Malawi news",Tech,United Kingdom,POSITIVE,0.9988757967948914

After a year of deep cuts in aid budgets by the US and European countries, the announcement of new money for the humanitarian system is a source of some relief, but experts are deeply concerned about demands that the US has imposed on how the money should be managed and where it can go. When the US state department announced the pledge on Tuesday, it said the UN must “adapt, shrink or die” by implementing changes and eliminating waste, and demanded that the money be funnelled through a pooled fund under the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) rather than to individual agencies. It also stipulated that the money be used for 17 priority countries chosen by the US, excluding some undergoing profound humanitarian crises such as Afghanistan and Yemen. Themrise Khan, an independent researcher on aid systems, said: “It’s a despicable way of looking at humanitarianism and humanitarian aid.” She criticised the way the UN had praised Donald Trump and the pledge as “generous” despite the many conditions placed upon it. “It also points to the fact that the UN system itself is now so subservient to the American system – that it is literally bowing down to just one power without actually being more objective in how it views humanitarianism and humanitarian aid,” Khan said. “For me, that is the nail in the coffin.” The 17 priority countries include some of the world’s most desperate, where the US has political interests, including Sudan, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo , as well as some Latin American countries. Ronny Patz, an independent analyst specialising in UN finances, said: “The fact that they are announcing a selected list of countries in advance shows they have very clear political priorities for this money.” He said he was concerned that Washington’s demands on where the money could be spent “solidifies a massively shrunk UN humanitarian system”. “If there is a new humanitarian crisis breaking out in some region of the world next year that they haven’t prioritised funding for, it’s not clear that they are willing to let the UN respond with US money,” Patz said. There are also concerns that the amount of money will not be enough. Thomas Byrnes, chief executive of MarketImpact, a consultancy for the humanitarian sector, has been tracking aid cuts throughout the past year and said the $2bn was significantly less than the $3.38bn in funds given by the US to the UN in 2025, all of which was provided under the previous Biden administration. “This is a carefully staged political announcement that obscures more than it reveals,” said Byrnes. He said the contribution was better than nothing but that it would have a limited impact in the context of other US decisions, including cutting $5bn in foreign assistance already approved by Congress as “woke, weaponised and wasteful spending” and a proposal to end support for peacekeeping missions – for which it already owes the United Nations $1.5bn . Byrnes suggested that channelling the money through Ocha may be less about partnership and more an attempt to centralise control and have one UN body on which to make demands about how aid should be distributed. Patz shared that concern and said he was worried about whether the money would even materialise if the UN failed to meet the expectations set out by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to “cut bloat, remove duplication” . “I would be cautious,” he said. “This is $2bn promised, but not $2bn given.” Aid Aid cuts Trump administration US foreign policy United Nations USAID US politics Humanitarian response news","US ‘adapt, shrink or die’ terms for $2bn aid pot will mean UN bowing down to Washington, say experts Afghanistan and Yemen excluded from list of 17 priority countries chosen by Trump administration to receive aid laden with demands The $2bn (£1.5bn) of aid the US pledged this week may have been hailed as “bold and ambitious” by the UN but could be the “nail in the coffin” in changing to a shrunken, less flexible aid system dominated by Washington’s political priorities, aid experts fear.

Doumbouya, 41, faced eight rivals for the presidency but the main opposition leaders were barred from running and had urged a boycott of the vote held over the weekend. The general’s decision to stand meant he reneged on a vow not to run for office and to hand the mineral-rich but poor west African country back to civilian rule by the end of 2024. He secured 86.72% of the first-round vote, the country’s election commission said late on Tuesday, well over the threshold that would trigger a runoff vote. Turnout stood at 80.95%, according to Djenabou Touré, the head of the general directorate of elections. Doumbouya had placed well ahead in districts of the capital, Conakry, often winning more than 80%, according to official partial results read out by Touré earlier on RTG public television. He had a similar lead in several other areas, including Coyah, a town near Conakry, and in other parts of the country, such as Boffa and Fria in the west, Gaoual in the north-west, northern Koundara and Labe, and Nzerekore in the south-east. However, a citizens’ movement calling for the return of civilian rule questioned the figure. “A huge majority of Guineans chose to boycott the electoral charade,” the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution said in a statement on Monday. In September 2021, Doumbouya led a coup to topple Guinea’s first freely elected president, Alpha Condé. He has cracked down on civil liberties and banned protests, while opponents have been arrested, put on trial or driven into exile. The candidate Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé denounced “serious irregularities” in the poll. Another candidate, Faya Millimono, complained of “electoral banditry” linked, he said, to influence exerted on voters. In late September, Guineans approved a new constitution in a referendum that permitted junta members to run for office, paving the way for Doumbouya’s candidacy. It also lengthened presidential terms from five to seven years, renewable once. The opposition leader, the former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, was one of three opposition leaders barred from standing by the new constitution. Diallo was excluded because he lives in exile and his primary residence is outside of Guinea.

Caracas was giving Washington “everything that we feel is necessary” and the US would remain a political overlord there for an indefinite period, the US president said. “We will rebuild it in a very profitable way,” Trump told the New York Times . “We’re going to be using oil, and we’re going to be taking oil.” Asked how long the White House would demand direct oversight of Venezuela, he said “only time will tell”. Asked if it would be longer than a year, he replied: “I would say much longer.” His comments came after Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez , defended plans to open up her country’s oil market to Washington. Rodríguez said on Wednesday that the US attack to remove her predecessor, Nicolás Maduro , had put a “stain” on the countries’ relations, but that it was “not unusual or irregular” to trade with the US, adding that Venezuela was “open to energy relations where all parties benefit”. In his New York Times interview Trump made a similar claim, saying: “We’re getting oil prices down, and we’re going to be giving money to Venezuela , which they desperately need.” Trump did not answer questions about why he endorsed Rodríguez – a veteran member of a government he has accused of “narco-terrorism” – as Venezuela’s new leader instead of backing María Corina Machado, the opposition leader who led a successful election campaign in 2024 and won the Nobel peace prize. He declined to say if he had spoken to Rodríguez but said his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, did so “all the time”. The president made no commitments about when Venezuela might hold elections. US forces seized a pair of sanctions-hit tankers on Wednesday and the administration announced it would manage all sales of Venezuela’s future crude production and oversee the sale of the country’s petroleum worldwide . Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, said: “We’re going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela.” On Thursday, Wright said there would be room for China to also have a role in Venezuela’s commercial relations, but only as long as the US remained “the dominant force there”. “Within that framework, where Venezuela’s main partner … is the US, can there be commerce with China? Sure. Are we going to allow Venezuela to become a client state of China? Absolutely not,” he told Fox Business Network. In another interview on Fox News, the US vice-president, JD Vance, said Venezuela would be able to sell its oil only if it served the interests of Washington. “We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime: you’re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America’s national interest, you’re not allowed to sell it if you can’t serve America’s national interest,” Vance said. On Tuesday, Trump announced a deal to access to up to $3bn worth of Venezuelan crude, a sign that Venezuelan government officials are responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention. On top of the ongoing embargo on oil, the US energy department has said the “only oil transported in and out of Venezuela” will be through approved channels consistent with US law and national security interests. That level of control over the world’s largest proven reserves of crude oil could give the Trump administration a broader hold on oil supplies globally in ways that could enable it to influence prices. Since the capture of Maduro , Trump has continued to pledge that the US will “run” the country, despite pushback from Rodríguez . On Wednesday, Trump said Venezuela would only buy US-made products with the profits it makes from any deal with Washington to sell oil. In a social media post, he wrote: “I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal.” Trump is scheduled to meet the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of raising Venezuela’s oil production. The Financial Times reported that oil executives were expected to press the president on providing strong legal and financial guarantees before they agreed to commit capital to Venezuela. US officials had in recent weeks told US oil executives they would need to return to Venezuela quickly and invest significant capital there to revive the damaged industry, Reuters reported earlier this week. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the US had begun scaling back its naval presence in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, moving the USS Iwo Jima and the USS San Antonio to waters north of Cuba in the Atlantic and reducing troop numbers from about 15,000 to 12,000. It remains unclear, however, whether this marks the beginning of a de-escalation or merely a temporary reduction. On Thursday night, Venezuela’s interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, said the death toll from the US attack had reached 100 – including Venezuelan and Cuban soldiers as well as civilians – with a similar number injured. While the regime has held funerals for 24 Venezuelan troops and Cuba has released the names of 32 Cuban soldiers, few details are known about the remaining victims, aside from a handful of civilians identified so far, including Rosa Elena González , an 80-year-old woman killed in her apartment near a military base hit by a missile. Cabello, who has reportedly been warned by the Trump administration that he could be next to fall if he does not support Venezuela’s acting president, called Maduro’s capture a “barbaric, treacherous and terrible attack”. The minister also claimed – without providing evidence – that the original US plan did not include capturing Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores . “When they were taking away brother Nicolás Maduro, they were not going to take Cilia, and Cilia told them: ‘If you take my husband, you have to take me too, you have to take me too,’” said Cabello.

The US president has repeatedly raised the prospect of producing enough crude from Venezuela’s oilfields to drive down the US oil price from more than $56 a barrel today to about $50 in an effort to cut energy costs for consumers, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited senior Trump administration officials. Global oil markets have already recorded significant losses in recent years due to an oversupply of crude. Prices slumped by almost 20% in 2025, marking the biggest annual loss since the Covid-19 pandemic and the first time the oil market has recorded three consecutive years of annual losses. As well as driving market prices lower, officials reportedly claimed Trump’s plans to control Venezuela’s oil reserves, which are the largest in the world, include cutting Russia and China’s access to the South American country in order to establish a western hemisphere oil production stronghold. The White House confirmed on Wednesday the US planned to control Venezuela’s oil sales “indefinitely” after laying claim to 50m barrels of blockaded crude. The oil, which is stranded in tankers and storage facilities, could be worth up to $3bn (once sold on the global market, with the proceeds used to “benefit the Venezuelan people”, according to the US energy secretary, Chris Wright. On Wednesday, Trump said Venezuela would use the profits it made from any deal it struck with Washington to sell oil solely to buy US-made goods. “I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. The US laid claim to the under-sanctions crude this week, and also seized a Russian oil tanker linked to Venezuela after a two-week pursuit. If Trump was able to increase Venezuela’s oil output from 1m barrels a day (bpd), or less than 1% of global demand, to its previous highs of about 3m, he would bring US domestic production to about 14m bpd. This represents about one-third of the 40m bpd output of countries in the Opec+ alliance. However, there are doubts about whether Trump will be able to reignite Venezuela’s beleaguered oil industry after decades of underinvestment and corruption. The president has promised that US oil companies will return to the region to spend billions upgrading its infrastructure and growing its production. But the companies – including Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips – are reportedly wary. Trump said this week that US oil companies could be “reimbursed by us, or through revenue” if they invested in Venezuela. But executives have reportedly told the Financial Times they will want “serious guarantees” from the Trump administration before investing billions to increase Venezuela’s crude output. “No one wants to go in there when a random fucking tweet can change the entire foreign policy of the country,” one private equity investor who specialises in energy told the FT. Oil bosses met US officials at an industry conference in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, and are due to meet Trump at the White House on Friday. Oil Oil and gas companies Energy industry Commodities Trump administration US politics Venezuela news","Trump plans to use Venezuela’s huge crude reserves ‘to cut US oil price to $50 a barrel’ President reportedly hopes falling price will cut domestic consumer energy bills Business live – latest updates Business live – latest updates  Donald Trump plans to use Venezuela’s vast crude reserves to establish control of most of the western hemisphere’s oil in an attempt to drive the market price down to about $50 (£37) a barrel, according to reports. The US president has repeatedly raised the prospect of producing enough crude from Venezuela’s oilfields to drive down the US oil price from more than $56 a barrel today to about $50 in an effort to cut energy costs for consumers, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited senior Trump administration officials. Global oil markets have already recorded significant losses in recent years due to an oversupply of crude. Prices slumped by almost 20% in 2025, marking the biggest annual loss since the Covid-19 pandemic and the first time the oil market has recorded three consecutive years of annual losses. As well as driving market prices lower, officials reportedly claimed Trump’s plans to control Venezuela’s oil reserves, which are the largest in the world, include cutting Russia and China’s access to the South American country in order to establish a western hemisphere oil production stronghold. The White House confirmed on Wednesday the US planned to control Venezuela’s oil sales “indefinitely” after laying claim to 50m barrels of blockaded crude. The oil, which is stranded in tankers and storage facilities, could be worth up to $3bn (once sold on the global market, with the proceeds used to “benefit the Venezuelan people”, according to the US energy secretary, Chris Wright. On Wednesday, Trump said Venezuela would use the profits it made from any deal it struck with Washington to sell oil solely to buy US-made goods. “I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. The US laid claim to the under-sanctions crude this week, and also seized a Russian oil tanker linked to Venezuela after a two-week pursuit. If Trump was able to increase Venezuela’s oil output from 1m barrels a day (bpd), or less than 1% of global demand, to its previous highs of about 3m, he would bring US domestic production to about 14m bpd.

In Cúcuta, a city on Colombia’s eastern border with Venezuela , several hundred demonstrators marched towards its 19th century cathedral waving the country’s yellow, blue and red flag and shouting: “Fuera los yanquis!” (“Out with the Yanks!”) “Trump is the devil … he’s the most abhorrent person in the world,” said one demonstrator, a 55-year-old businesswoman called Janet Chacón. Another marcher, José Silva, 67, said the abduction of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, during Saturday’s attack made a mockery of Trump’s claim to be “the president of peace” . “He’s the president of war … he’s a maniac,” Silva declared. “The US congress needs to do something to get him out of the presidency … He’s a thug.” Colombia’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro, called Wednesday’s rallies after Trump indicated he favoured the idea of military action in Colombia , after Saturday’s audacious assault on Venezuela’s capital . Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and first lady Cilia Flores were captured, while dozens of Cuban and Venezuelan bodyguards were killed, during the dramatic US special forces raid on a military base in Caracas. “What happened in Venezuela was, in my opinion illegal,” Petro told thousands of supporters who had gathered at a rally in Bolívar plaza in Colombia’s capital, Bogotá. In front of the stage a protester held a placard reading: “Go to hell shitty yanks”. However, Petro took a less combative line after talking to Trump for the first time, shortly before his public statement. “It was a great honor to speak with the president of Colombia … I appreciated his ​call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future​,” Trump wrote on his social media platform​ Truth Social. Petro indicated he was willing to meet Trump but added: “We cannot lower our guard.” “Words need to be followed by deeds,” he added. On Sunday Trump called Petro “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States” – although there is no evidence Colombia’s leader is linked to the drug trade in his country, the world’s largest producer of cocaine. Asked if he would consider a Venezuela-style military intervention in Colombia, Trump told reporters: “It sounds good to me.” Trump’s attack on Venezuela – which he has admitted was in-part designed to secure “total access” to Venezuela’s massive oil reserves – and subsequent threats to Colombia have sent shock waves through Latin America. Demonstrators have this week hit the streets of cities including Mexico City, São Paulo and Buenos Aires to condemn the “Yankee invasion” and the possibility of further attacks. “The message from the people of Latin America is: ‘Donald Trump, get your hands off Latin America. Latin America isn’t the US’ back yard’,” said Reimont Otoni, a leftwing Brazilian congressman who led protests outside the US consulate in Rio on Monday. Otoni recognised Venezuela faced “a humanitarian and a democratic crisis” under Maduro. “[But] there isn’t the slightest chance that an aerial bombardment or the kidnapping of a country’s president … will fix this,” he said, condemning the failure of European leaders to denounce Trump’s intervention. “This is simply an assertion of North American imperialism … Trump wants to seize control of the biggest oil reserves in the world … and dominate Venezuela.” There was similar anger on Colombia’s streets during Wednesday’s marches, which the US embassy urged its citizens to avoid , claiming they had “the potential to turn violent”. “He doesn’t want to liberate Venezuela. He just wants the oil,” Marta Jiménez, a 65-year-old teacher, said of Trump as she stood in Cúcuta’s palm-dotted Santander Plaza. Jiménez slammed the international community’s failure to confront Trump. “They are leaving him to fly, free as a bird over every single country, to do whatever he likes,” she said, warning that while Venezuela and Colombia were Trump’s current targets, any Latin American nation could be the next. “It might be Nicaragua, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru – any of them,” she said. Another protester called Juan Carlos Silva, 59, feared that after the US attacked Venezuela, “they are coming for Colombia”. “We’re not against North America. There are lots of good people there. But this guy [Trump] is possessed by the devil,” he said. Silva recognised Maduro had been a dictator. But he believed Trump was more dangerous. “He’s trying to cause a third world war, just like Hitler did. He’s a fiend and he must be stopped.” Trump’s night-time assault on Caracas was by far the most dramatic of his interventions in Latin America since he returned to power one year ago. But it was by no means the first. In his inaugural address last January, the US president vowed to “take back” the Panama canal. He subsequently launched a pressure campaign of sanctions and tariffs against Brazil’s government in a failed bid to help his far-right ally, Jair Bolsonaro, escape jail for plotting a coup. Trump also waded into last month’s presidential election in Honduras, in support of the eventual right-wing winner, and offered an ideologically motivated multi-billion dollar bailout to Argentina’s right-wing president, Javier Milei. On Sunday Trump hinted at military action in Mexico to combat its drug cartels, telling reporters: “We’re going to have to do something.” Asked this week if Trump’s next target might be Cuba, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, replied: “They are in a lot of trouble, yes.” Trump’s moves have horrified Latin American diplomats, who fear a further US attack on Venezuela is possible. One called the White House’s behaviour “unhinged”. Benjamin Gedan, the South America director at the national security council under Barack Obama, said Trump had shown himself to be “astoundingly disinterested in US diplomatic relationships and the US image in the world”. “He has demonstrated absolutely no concern for the way the United States is viewed and for its relationships with governments of the region. He has concluded that he can bully governments into submission and that public opinion is meaningless and that soft power is irrelevant … It’s a bizarre approach to a region that he himself has identified as strategically important for the United States,” added Gedan, the director of the Latin America Program at the Stimson Center. “It seems like Trump goes out of his way to maximise the diplomatic wreckage .” Gedan said Trump could have tried to portray his capture of the “universally loathed” Maduro as a boon for democracy. “But instead of making a case or even gesturing toward democracy and human rights, he immediately pivots to a resource grab, alienating almost any potential ally who wants to make the case that this person should be gone for the interests of the country, its people, and the region. What leader in Latin America can sign on to this operation in the interest of the US oil sector? ” Gedan asked.

US European Command said on Wednesday that it had boarded the Marinera over alleged sanctions violations, bringing to an end a dramatic two-week pursuit that began in the Caribbean and concluded in the Atlantic. The Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT earlier published two grainy photographs showing a helicopter approaching the Marinera tanker, saying an operation was under way. The seizure – the first known US military seizure of a Russian-flagged vessel in recent history – is the latest demonstration of brazen US military power and reach. The US Coast Guard said on Wednesday it had separately intercepted another dark-fleet tanker that is under sanctions, the M Sophia, in a pre-dawn operation in the Caribbean. Commenting on the twin operations, the White House signalled it would continue to seize Venezuela-linked oil vessels after Donald Trump last month imposed what he described as a “complete blockade” on ships transporting oil for Caracas. “The US will enforce all sanctions,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters. Asked whether the seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic risked escalating tensions with Russia, Leavitt did not respond directly, saying the vessel’s crew could be transferred to the US for prosecution “if necessary”. The Russian foreign ministry has demanded the US ensure the humane and dignified treatment of Russian citizens onboard the Marinera and guarantee their swift return to Russia. Leavitt said: “The president has very good, open relationships with both President Putin and President Xi. He has spoken with them numerous times … and I believe those personal relationships are going to continue.” The Marinera had been navigating in the Atlantic between Iceland and the UK, according to ship-tracking data from MarineTraffic. The Wall Street Journal reported that several helicopters and at least one coastguard vessel were used to take control of the tanker. Britain provided support to the US in its operation, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. The Kremlin’s immediate reaction to the seizure has been notably muted, with Moscow appearing to continue its efforts to improve ties with Washington under Trump in the hope of securing his favour in talks over Ukraine. Russia’s transport ministry said in a statement that US forces had boarded the vessel outside the territorial waters of any state and that contact with it had been lost. The ministry cited the 1982 UN convention on the law of the sea, which says “no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered in the jurisdictions of other states”. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, wrote on X: “The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT – anywhere in the world.” The pursuit of the Marinera began after it turned back into the Atlantic while travelling from Iran to Venezuela, having attempted to evade a US blockade targeting sanction-hit oil tankers operating near Venezuelan waters. The operation is likely to strain relations with Vladimir Putin, coming at a sensitive moment as negotiations over a potential peace deal in Ukraine continue and after the US capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, a longstanding Kremlin ally. Ukraine’s foreign minister said Kyiv welcomed the seizure of the tanker, adding it was a good example of how to act against Moscow and said it showcased “President Trump’s resolute leadership”. “We welcome such an approach to dealing with Russia: act, not fear. This is also relevant to the peace process and bringing a lasting peace closer,” Andrii Sybiha wrote on X. The vessel is part of the so-called shadow fleet moving oil for Russia, Iran and Venezuela. It was placed under sanctions by the US in 2024 over allegations it carried illicit cargo for a Hezbollah-owned company. Initial reports suggest the ageing tanker is empty, having been en route to pick up Venezuelan oil before changing course. Even so, Moscow appears to have gone to considerable lengths to protect the vessel, raising questions about why it is willing to risk a standoff with the west over it. The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday that the Russian navy had deployed a submarine to escort the tanker, heightening the stakes of any confrontation in the North Atlantic. In the 24 hours preceding the operation, western surveillance flights were observed over the vessel, including aircraft from US bases in Iceland, and RAF Rivet Joint and P-8 Poseidon planes from the UK, which are capable of detecting submarines. In December, the crew repelled an attempted US boarding near Venezuelan waters. The vessel was subsequently renamed from Bella 1 to Marinera, a Russian flag was painted on its hull and it was added to Russia’s official shipping registry. Moscow later lodged a formal diplomatic protest demanding that Washington halt its pursuit. The tanker departed the Gulf of Oman in November, transiting the Suez canal and the strait of Gibraltar before crossing the Atlantic in early December. As US pressure on Venezuela intensified – culminating in the capture of Maduro – the vessel stopped abruptly near the Caribbean on 15 December and reversed course, heading back towards Europe. Marinera’s return journey across the Atlantic has been markedly atypical, according to marine transport experts. Instead of taking the usual route through the Channel, the tanker veered sharply north, steering into the stretch of ocean between Iceland and Ireland. Mikhail Zvinchuk, an influential military blogger with close ties to Russia’s defence ministry, said the decision to reflag the vessel under Russian jurisdiction shortly before its seizure had placed Moscow in an extremely awkward position. He said the move “sets a precedent for further operations against Russia’s so-called shadow fleet, not only in the Atlantic but in other regions of the world as well”. Registry data reviewed by the New York Times showed that at least three other oil tankers that had operated in Venezuelan waters in recent weeks had since been reflagged under the Russian banner, pointing to a growing trend of Moscow extending its registry to vessels facing US sanctions. The move could complicate relations between Moscow and Washington at a time when Trump has shown frustration with Putin over Russia’s continued fighting in Ukraine. US foreign policy Russia Venezuela Europe Americas US attack on Venezuela news","US seizes Russian-flagged oil tanker in Atlantic after two-week pursuit US European Command says it boarded the Marinera over alleged sanctions violations, a move that risks confrontation with Moscow The US has seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic Ocean in a high-stakes operation that could risk confrontation with the Kremlin after Moscow reportedly dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel. US European Command said on Wednesday that it had boarded the Marinera over alleged sanctions violations, bringing to an end a dramatic two-week pursuit that began in the Caribbean and concluded in the Atlantic. The Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT earlier published two grainy photographs showing a helicopter approaching the Marinera tanker, saying an operation was under way. The seizure – the first known US military seizure of a Russian-flagged vessel in recent history – is the latest demonstration of brazen US military power and reach. The US Coast Guard said on Wednesday it had separately intercepted another dark-fleet tanker that is under sanctions, the M Sophia, in a pre-dawn operation in the Caribbean. Commenting on the twin operations, the White House signalled it would continue to seize Venezuela-linked oil vessels after Donald Trump last month imposed what he described as a “complete blockade” on ships transporting oil for Caracas. “The US will enforce all sanctions,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters. Asked whether the seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic risked escalating tensions with Russia, Leavitt did not respond directly, saying the vessel’s crew could be transferred to the US for prosecution “if necessary”. The Russian foreign ministry has demanded the US ensure the humane and dignified treatment of Russian citizens onboard the Marinera and guarantee their swift return to Russia. Leavitt said: “The president has very good, open relationships with both President Putin and President Xi. He has spoken with them numerous times … and I believe those personal relationships are going to continue.” The Marinera had been navigating in the Atlantic between Iceland and the UK, according to ship-tracking data from MarineTraffic. The Wall Street Journal reported that several helicopters and at least one coastguard vessel were used to take control of the tanker. Britain provided support to the US in its operation, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. The Kremlin’s immediate reaction to the seizure has been notably muted, with Moscow appearing to continue its efforts to improve ties with Washington under Trump in the hope of securing his favour in talks over Ukraine. Russia’s transport ministry said in a statement that US forces had boarded the vessel outside the territorial waters of any state and that contact with it had been lost. The ministry cited the 1982 UN convention on the law of the sea, which says “no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered in the jurisdictions of other states”. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, wrote on X: “The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT – anywhere in the world.” The pursuit of the Marinera began after it turned back into the Atlantic while travelling from Iran to Venezuela, having attempted to evade a US blockade targeting sanction-hit oil tankers operating near Venezuelan waters. The operation is likely to strain relations with Vladimir Putin, coming at a sensitive moment as negotiations over a potential peace deal in Ukraine continue and after the US capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, a longstanding Kremlin ally. Ukraine’s foreign minister said Kyiv welcomed the seizure of the tanker, adding it was a good example of how to act against Moscow and said it showcased “President Trump’s resolute leadership”. “We welcome such an approach to dealing with Russia: act, not fear. This is also relevant to the peace process and bringing a lasting peace closer,” Andrii Sybiha wrote on X. The vessel is part of the so-called shadow fleet moving oil for Russia, Iran and Venezuela. It was placed under sanctions by the US in 2024 over allegations it carried illicit cargo for a Hezbollah-owned company.

The surprise arrest of Chen is the biggest step yet in efforts by a number of countries to crack down on sprawling compounds in south-east Asia that house tens of thousands of workers, many trafficked and forced into scamming victims around the world, in what the United Nations says has evolved into a sophisticated global industry. The extradition of the young tycoon was announced late on Wednesday by Cambodia, the base of his Prince Group of businesses, after what its interior ministry said was a months-long joint transnational crime investigation with China . It is not immediately clear what charges Chen, who was born in China, faces. China’s ministry of foreign affairs said authorities were collaborating to combat cross-border telecom fraud scams. “China is willing to strengthen law enforcement cooperation with neighbouring countries, including Cambodia, to safeguard the safety of people’s lives and property,” the ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said.

Cambodia’s central bank on Thursday announced the liquidation of Prince Bank, a lender founded by Chen, the latest in a series of moves against entities under or linked to the group across Asia, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Taiwan and South Korea. It gave no reason for the liquidation and it was not immediately clear whether Cambodian authorities would target other Prince Group entities. Britain and the US imposed sanctions on Prince Group in October and weeks later authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore froze or seized assets worth $354m and $116m linked to the company, which has businesses ranging from real estate and financial services to banking, leisure and hospitality. Prince Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday and Prince Group could not be reached. Prince Group said in November that US allegations of criminal activity by Chen were baseless and aimed at unlawfully seizing billions of dollars. CCTV said on Thursday that Chen was wanted on suspicion of fraud and operating illegal casinos. It said authorities would release a wanted list of key members of the “Chen Zhi criminal group” whom it urged to surrender at once. Cambodia’s interior ministry said on Wednesday that it had extradited three Chinese nationals including Chen to China at Beijing’s request. The Cambodian ministry statement did not provide details on Chen or his alleged crimes, but it said his Cambodian citizenship had been revoked. Beijing’s public security bureau set up a special taskforce to investigate individuals involved with Prince Group in 2020, calling the group a “mega cross-border online gambling syndicate”, a Chinese court document released in 2022 showed.

Nicta is now waiting on the ombudsman or the courts in PNG to issue a directive over whether it will be granted a licence. No timing has been provided on when a directive will be issued. Starlink did not respond to a request for comment. In an email to customers, it said it wanted to provide internet in PNG once approvals were granted. There are no official figures on how many people use Starlink in PNG but the shutdown is causing distress for internet users across the country. Telecommunications analysts have estimated that before the shutdown, Starlink terminals served thousands of people, including some entire villages or districts in remote areas in the country. The service was mostly used in rural areas where mobile networks are unreliable or do not exist. Other satellite services are available but are often much more expensive. Businessman and former Maprik MP John Simon said the shutdown ignored the struggles of ordinary people and small businesses in PNG. “This is really bad for this country. Internet and online services have been very expensive and slow for years, yet we cannot listen to the little people out on the street and sort this out,” he said. “The PNG government must do something for the struggling small [businesses]. Ordinary people and small [businesses] rely on the cheapest and fastest option, and right now that is Starlink. This issue must be sorted.” The country’s communication minister declined to comment. About 200 people have signed an online petition asking for Starlink to be allowed to operate legally. Health workers and teachers have also said losing Starlink has affected their work and access to services. Businesses have said their ability to reach customers and process payments has been disrupted, and some farmers and traders now have to travel long distances to towns to access banking and other services. Simon Jack, a teacher at a high school in a remote part of Southern Highlands province, said the shutdown was making life hard for students. “Students need internet to check their results and see where they have been selected to study [this year]. For many of them, Starlink was the only option that worked.” Health worker Theresa Juni, from East Sepik province, said Starlink helped her clinic communicate with doctors in town and send reports quickly. “Now we have to wait days or travel just to send information. For patients who need urgent care, these delays can be dangerous.” Starlink has faced licensing issues in the Pacific before. In 2024, Tonga’s government ordered the internet satellite company to cease operations until it was granted a licence.

The US on Saturday revealed the details of a surprise raid to capture Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro , who was whisked away to the US, where he was frogmarched into a court in New York on Monday . Commentators in China immediately drew comparisons to how an assault on Taiwan could play out. China, a country with more than 1.4 billion people and the world’s biggest armed forces, has long had designs on Taiwan , a self-governing island of 23 million in its back yard. The imbalance in power is comparable to that between the US, which possesses the world’s most powerful army, and Venezuela, a small, middle-income country of just 30m which, like Taiwan, relies on friendly countries for its defence. On Monday, Emily Thornberry, the chair of the UK’s foreign affairs committee, warned that China and Russia may be emboldened by the lack of condemnation for the US’s actions. But events in the Americas are unlikely to change Beijing’s fundamental thinking with regards to Taiwan. Firstly, although China cares about international narratives with regards to Taiwan, and puts great pressure on other countries to recognise Beijing’s claims on the island, it does not see the matter as being one of international laws. Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and therefore a domestic political matter. “Beijing has not refrained from kinetic or other actions on Taiwan out of deference to international law and norms. It has pursued a strategy of coercion without violence,” said Ryan Hass, a former US diplomat in Beijing and a senior fellow at Brookings. Shen Dingli, a senior international relations scholar in Shanghai, laid out the official view: “Cross-strait relations are not international relations and are not governed by international law. The United States’ approach to Venezuela holds no relevance for cross-strait relations.” On the Chinese social media site Weibo, one popular nationalist government affairs commentator wrote: “Stop linking the US actions in Venezuela to the Taiwan issue … Their actions constitute a grave violation of international law and an infringement on Venezuela’s sovereignty, whereas our situation is strictly an internal national affair. There is absolutely no ‘comparability’ in terms of nature, methods or objectives.” Secondly, the biggest deterrence for China in launching an attack on Taiwan is the military balance in the Taiwan Strait. Although China has a more powerful military, Taiwan has the promise of support from the US in the event of an attack. Last week, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) conducted several days of intense military drills around Taiwan , designed to showcase its ability to blockade the island and fend off international assistance. The US Department of Defense believes that the PLA is on track to reach its 2027 goal of being able to achieve a “strategic decisive victory” over Taiwan, particularly with its rapid advances in military artificial intelligence, biotechnology and hypersonic missiles. But rather than feel worried by the news in Venezuela, many in Taiwan argued that the successful US military operation may actually give Beijing pause for thought. Some pointed out that Venezuela’s China-sourced weapons failed to defend against the US attack. Between 2010 and 2020, nearly 90% of China’s arms sales to the Americas went to Venezuela, according to ChinaPower, a research project hosted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “Why was the US military able to move in as if no one were there?” said Lin Ying Yu, an associate professor at Tamkang University in Taipei. “Everyone seemed to think that Chinese-made weapons were very impressive after the clashes between Indian and Pakistani air forces,” Lin said, referring to the success of Chinese-made jets used by Pakistan in a brief conflict with India last year. “But now, there seems to be a different interpretation.” Sung Wen-Ti, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub who is based in Taiwan, said: “The US military’s capacity for a decapitation strike, especially against Venezuela’s largely Chinese defence systems, ought to provide a deterrent that makes Beijing think about putting their [military] to the test against Washington.” Still, Donald Trump’s flagrant disregard for the international rules-based order, and the speed at which western leaders have toed Washington’s line, reveals the upending of global norms that is under way. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has declined to condemn Trump’s actions , despite the fact that experts have described the attack as illegal under international law. Many European leaders have also equivocated . China said on Monday that the US’s “blatant use of force against Venezuela seriously violates international law and basic norms in international relations”. China, along with Russia, backed an emergency UN security council meeting over the legality of the operation. Taiwan’s government declined to comment on the US’s actions, despite the fact that Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has repeatedly talked of the need to defend the international rules-based order as a means of preventing a Chinese invasion. One popular Taiwanese blogger argued that in order to prevent itself from becoming “another Venezuela”, Taiwan should avoid causing trouble for the US, such as by becoming a source of drugs or refugees. In a Facebook post that received more than 30,000 likes, the popular YouTuber Chiu Wei-chieh, also known as “Froggy” Chiu, said that unlike in Venezuela, Taiwan’s leader has the popular support of the people. “Taiwan should not become Venezuela. That means clenching our five fingers tighter, uniting, and not becoming easy prey in their eyes,” he wrote.

Between 2010 and 2020, nearly 90% of China’s arms sales to the Americas went to Venezuela, according to ChinaPower, a research project hosted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “Why was the US military able to move in as if no one were there?” said Lin Ying Yu, an associate professor at Tamkang University in Taipei. “Everyone seemed to think that Chinese-made weapons were very impressive after the clashes between Indian and Pakistani air forces,” Lin said, referring to the success of Chinese-made jets used by Pakistan in a brief conflict with India last year. “But now, there seems to be a different interpretation.” Sung Wen-Ti, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub who is based in Taiwan, said: “The US military’s capacity for a decapitation strike, especially against Venezuela’s largely Chinese defence systems, ought to provide a deterrent that makes Beijing think about putting their [military] to the test against Washington.” Still, Donald Trump’s flagrant disregard for the international rules-based order, and the speed at which western leaders have toed Washington’s line, reveals the upending of global norms that is under way. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has declined to condemn Trump’s actions , despite the fact that experts have described the attack as illegal under international law. Many European leaders have also equivocated . China said on Monday that the US’s “blatant use of force against Venezuela seriously violates international law and basic norms in international relations”. China, along with Russia, backed an emergency UN security council meeting over the legality of the operation. Taiwan’s government declined to comment on the US’s actions, despite the fact that Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has repeatedly talked of the need to defend the international rules-based order as a means of preventing a Chinese invasion. One popular Taiwanese blogger argued that in order to prevent itself from becoming “another Venezuela”, Taiwan should avoid causing trouble for the US, such as by becoming a source of drugs or refugees. In a Facebook post that received more than 30,000 likes, the popular YouTuber Chiu Wei-chieh, also known as “Froggy” Chiu, said that unlike in Venezuela, Taiwan’s leader has the popular support of the people. “Taiwan should not become Venezuela. That means clenching our five fingers tighter, uniting, and not becoming easy prey in their eyes,” he wrote.

Through thick and thin!” Those bonds will be put to the test now that the US president, Donald Trump, has upended the government of one of China’s key “all-weather” strategic partners in Latin America, the term officially adopted in a joint statement signed by Maduro and China’s president, Xi Jinping, in 2023. China has, unlike European countries , led the charge in condemning the US’s actions in removing by force the head of a foreign state. China has also called for Maduro’s release and backed a UN security council meeting, requested by Colombia, to debate Trump’s decision to seize him. On Sunday, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said: “We have never believed that any country can act as the world’s police, nor do we accept that any nation can claim to be the world’s judge.” Chinese social media was awash with content condemning the US operation , with many accusing Washington of colonialism, while content that celebrated Maduro’s capture appeared to be censored. Wang Yiwei, the director of the international affairs institute at Renmin University in Beijing, said Trump’s actions were “imperialist” and that Venezuela was likely “just the first” country in Latin America to be subjected to this kind of assault. China has been boosting its diplomacy and investment in Latin America for years, challenging US influence in Washington’s back yard. Last year, Beijing hosted a dialogue between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries and announced that China-Latin America trade had reached a record high of $519bn. So Beijing will also be concerned about what the crisis in Venezuela means for China’s interests in the oil-rich country and for its influence in the region. Venezuela is the fourth-biggest recipient of loans from Chinese official lenders, receiving about $106bn in commitments between 2000 and 2023, according to AidData, a research institute at William and Mary University in Virginia. In 2024, Venezuela’s debts to China were thought to total about $10bn. On Monday, China’s top financial regulator asked major lenders to report their exposure to Venezuela, reported Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources. Victor Shih, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, said: “If under US pressure, the Venezuelan government, which is highly indebted to multiple actors, places US creditors and claimants well ahead of Chinese ones, Chinese banks may see a significant amount of losses.” As with the US, many of China’s interests in Venezuela are linked to oil. For years, Beijing has extended credit to Venezuela in loan-for-oil deals, which has made China the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude. In December, a tanker bound for China and thought to be carrying Venezuelan oil was seized by US forces as part of Trump’s campaign against Maduro’s regime. The money owed by Venezuelan borrowers is likely to be more important to Beijing than the oil itself. Venezuelan oil only accounts for about 4% of China’s total imports. Shih said Beijing might be able to use its well-established leverage against the US, such as its ability to halt the export of rare earths , to force the US to come to some kind of deal with Chinese creditors. “For example, future oil proceeds can be split in a way that still leaves substantial cash flows to Chinese creditors, who can restructure the debt to have slightly lower interest and longer duration.” The economic repercussions for China may rest upon who ultimately takes control in Venezuela. Trump said the US would “run” the South American country but this may be in the form of a puppet regime rather than US forces. That would provide Beijing with cover to seek settlement with Caracas directly rather than negotiate with the US in the midst of an already challenging trade war. Trump has said the US will exploit Venezuela’s rich oil reserves to “rebuild” the country, while his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has suggested the US will hold Venezuela’s oil exports hostage to exert leverage on the new leadership in Caracas. Shen Dingli, a senior international relations scholar in Shanghai, said: “Should Venezuela’s new government decide not to honour agreements made by the Maduro administration, China would have no choice but to pursue international litigation.” Shen said any legal action would be targeted at Venezuela rather than the US.

On Thursday, from that very same lectern, he declared such an inquiry was vital to “heal” and unite a wounded nation after its worst-ever terror attack. Which invites the obvious question: What prompted such a screeching reversal? “I respect people’s views and I listen to them,” Albanese told a press conference in the prime minister’s courtyard at Parliament House in Canberra. “I take the time to choose the right path, the course of action that will make a positive difference to our country.” The “right path” will involve a federal royal commission into antisemitism and social cohesion, to be led by the former high court justice Virginia Bell. The federal government will still be able to get quick answers, with former spy chief Dennis Richardson’s snap review of intelligence and security agencies to be folded into the broader inquiry. The royal commission won’t drag on for years, with Bell due to report no later than 14 December – exactly 12 months on from the massacre that killed 15 people and wounded 40 others. The terms of reference will require the inquiry to not prejudice current or future criminal trials and be conducted in a format that does not platform racial hatred. As Albanese calmly stepped through each of these aspects of the inquiry on Thursday afternoon, he methodically exposed the illegitimacy of the arguments he and his ministers have mounted in the past fortnight to defend not calling it. The truth is the “right path” was always visible and open – Albanese simply decided not to take it. Sources familiar with the prime minister’s thinking since the Bondi attack insist he was never hostile to a royal commission, just laser-focused on what immediate steps could be taken, including on hate speech, gun control and responding to Jillian Segal’s antisemitism review. Critics, including inside the Labor caucus, are far more cynical, adamant the prime minister made a cold political calculation that to hold a royal commission would be more damaging than to resist one. Some colleagues believe Albanese became more inclined to dig in as open letter after open letter calling for a royal commission was splashed across the front pages of national newspapers. It is true that some parts of the highly coordinated and relentless letter-writing campaign were politically motivated. But it is also true that others were not, a reality clouded – including, perhaps for Albanese – by the hyper-partisanship that has regrettably defined the political fallout to the tragedy. When relatives of 11 of the victims of the Bondi attack appealed to the prime minister for a national inquiry on 29 December, Albanese could and should have rethought his position, at least leaving open the possibility of a federal inquiry. Instead, together with the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, he mounted a new argument that a royal commission would platform anti-Jewish hate and in doing so retraumatise the community. That suggestion caused deep offence and insult to members of the Jewish community who wanted a royal commission for the very reason that it would put a spotlight on antisemitism. “It was bullshit,” one Labor MP said of the argument. As the public pressure grew over the past week, threatening to distract from Labor’s agenda for the foreseeable future, Albanese had little choice but to back down. The government’s two best communicators, Jim Chalmers and Mark Butler, separately set the scene for a change of course on Monday and Tuesday morning, expressing empathy with advocates of a royal commission while not criticising the case for one. When the prime minister declined to rule out a national inquiry at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, it was only a matter of time. As he announced the royal commission on Thursday, he said: “I’ve said repeatedly that our government’s priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity and to go forward knowing that, just like people who gathered that night on Bondi beach were committing to, that light will prevail over darkness. “It’s clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.” The problem for Albanese is that, for many, it was clear all along.

On Thursday, from that very same lectern, he declared such an inquiry was vital to “heal” and unite a wounded nation after its worst-ever terror attack. Which invites the obvious question: What prompted such a screeching reversal? “I respect people’s views and I listen to them,” Albanese told a press conference in the prime minister’s courtyard at Parliament House in Canberra. “I take the time to choose the right path, the course of action that will make a positive difference to our country.” The “right path” will involve a federal royal commission into antisemitism and social cohesion, to be led by the former high court justice Virginia Bell. The federal government will still be able to get quick answers, with former spy chief Dennis Richardson’s snap review of intelligence and security agencies to be folded into the broader inquiry. The royal commission won’t drag on for years, with Bell due to report no later than 14 December – exactly 12 months on from the massacre that killed 15 people and wounded 40 others. The terms of reference will require the inquiry to not prejudice current or future criminal trials and be conducted in a format that does not platform racial hatred. As Albanese calmly stepped through each of these aspects of the inquiry on Thursday afternoon, he methodically exposed the illegitimacy of the arguments he and his ministers have mounted in the past fortnight to defend not calling it. The truth is the “right path” was always visible and open – Albanese simply decided not to take it. Sources familiar with the prime minister’s thinking since the Bondi attack insist he was never hostile to a royal commission, just laser-focused on what immediate steps could be taken, including on hate speech, gun control and responding to Jillian Segal’s antisemitism review. Critics, including inside the Labor caucus, are far more cynical, adamant the prime minister made a cold political calculation that to hold a royal commission would be more damaging than to resist one. Some colleagues believe Albanese became more inclined to dig in as open letter after open letter calling for a royal commission was splashed across the front pages of national newspapers. It is true that some parts of the highly coordinated and relentless letter-writing campaign were politically motivated. But it is also true that others were not, a reality clouded – including, perhaps for Albanese – by the hyper-partisanship that has regrettably defined the political fallout to the tragedy. When relatives of 11 of the victims of the Bondi attack appealed to the prime minister for a national inquiry on 29 December, Albanese could and should have rethought his position, at least leaving open the possibility of a federal inquiry. Instead, together with the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, he mounted a new argument that a royal commission would platform anti-Jewish hate and in doing so retraumatise the community. That suggestion caused deep offence and insult to members of the Jewish community who wanted a royal commission for the very reason that it would put a spotlight on antisemitism. “It was bullshit,” one Labor MP said of the argument. As the public pressure grew over the past week, threatening to distract from Labor’s agenda for the foreseeable future, Albanese had little choice but to back down. The government’s two best communicators, Jim Chalmers and Mark Butler, separately set the scene for a change of course on Monday and Tuesday morning, expressing empathy with advocates of a royal commission while not criticising the case for one. When the prime minister declined to rule out a national inquiry at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, it was only a matter of time. As he announced the royal commission on Thursday, he said: “I’ve said repeatedly that our government’s priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity and to go forward knowing that, just like people who gathered that night on Bondi beach were committing to, that light will prevail over darkness. “It’s clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.” The problem for Albanese is that, for many, it was clear all along.

But the federal Coalition instantly criticised Albanese’s move, with Liberal leader Sussan Ley claiming he should have appointed more commissioners to run the inquiry and stopping short of endorsing his proposed terms of reference. In a press conference, Albanese defended not calling a federal commission sooner, telling media he had been listening to the wide calls for a commission, and downplaying concerns he had earlier raised about a commonwealth inquiry , including that it would take too long or platform antisemitic hate. “Our government’s priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity and to go forward knowing that, just like people who gathered that night on Bondi beach were committing to, that light will prevail over darkness.

Sign up: AU Breaking News email “I’ve taken the time to reflect, to meet with leaders in the Jewish community and most importantly, I’ve met with many of the families of victims and survivors of that horrific attack.” Shortly after Albanese’s press conference, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, released a statement, confirming his state’s previously announced royal commission would no longer go ahead, and instead his government would cooperate with the federal inquiry. The commonwealth royal commission will report before 14 December 2026. Amid growing calls from families of the Bondi victims, Jewish community groups, and politicians across the nation, including his own Labor caucus , the prime minister backtracked in recent days on his earlier reluctance to such an inquiry. The shooting at a Hanukah event in Bondi, allegedly carried out by a father and son inspired by Islamic State, claimed the lives of 15 people. The former high court justice Virginia Bell has been named to lead the commission to investigate antisemitism and the Bondi attack. Bell, who was appointed counsel on NSW’s Wood royal commission into the police service in 1994, has also served as a judge on NSW’s supreme court and court of appeal, and on the high court from 2009 to 2021. She was also commissioned by Albanese’s Labor government in 2022 to investigate former prime minister Scott Morrison’s secret decisions to appoint himself to multiple ministerial portfolios without the knowledge of the ministers in those roles. Albanese said a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies by the former Asio chief Dennis Richardson would now feed into the federal royal commission, with the commission to provide an interim report in April. However he wouldn’t confirm whether Richardson’s inquiries would hold public hearings, as a royal commission normally would, saying such details would be up to the commissioner. “This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,” Albanese said. Albanese’s announcement followed a mounting public pressure campaign from across Australian society, including an emotional open letter from families of most of the Bondi victims calling for a royal commission into the attack and the broader issue of antisemitism in Australia. The federal Coalition and others in parliament have backed calls from Jewish community groups for an inquiry to investigate antisemitism, with broader calls for a probe into questions about intelligence, law enforcement and firearms laws. One of the alleged shooters, Naveed Akram – who has been charged with dozens of offences , including 15 counts of murder – had been investigated by Asio in October 2019 for alleged associations with individuals involved in a reported Islamic State cell. His father was later approved for a gun licence. Ley described Albanese’s recent actions as “fumble and flounder”, and that he had been “forced” to call a royal commission under mounting public pressure. She accused Albanese of seeking to “limit” the royal commission by only appointing one commissioner, not three as the Coalition had suggested. Albanese had rejected the Coalition’s proposed terms of reference as far too long and complicated. “The pleas of the families of victims, the Jewish community and the wider community have finally been heeded, but as always, Anthony Albanese has only acted when he judged it was in his political interest. His political interest is the only thing that guides him, never the national interest,” Ley claimed. “A single commissioner is inadequate for an inquiry of this scale, complexity and importance.” She said the Coalition would examine the government’s terms of reference, but declined to endorse them on Thursday evening. The federal government had previously been committed only to a narrow inquiry, led by Richardson, into the national intelligence and law enforcement community – a step the former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who has led calls for a royal commission, rubbished as “bullshit”. Frydenberg, who had earlier claimed Jewish leaders “have serious concerns about [Bell’s] appointment” – without detailing what those concerns were – struck a conciliatory tone on social media after the royal commission was confirmed, welcoming the news and calling it “an opportunity to reset, rebuild and repair our nation”.

The festival covers arts, music, talks and theatre and includes Adelaide’s annual Writers’ Week next month, where Abdel-Fattah was due to appear for the second time after hosting a number of panels and sessions in 2023. In a statement on Thursday, the festival’s board said it had been “shocked and saddened by the tragic events at Bondi” and the “significant heightening of both community tensions and the community debate”. “As the Board responsible for the Adelaide Festival organisation and all Adelaide Writers’ Week events, staff, volunteers and participants, we have today advised scheduled writer Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah that the Board has formed the judgment that we do not wish to proceed with her scheduled appearance at next month’s Writers’ Week,” it said. Within hours of the board’s announcement, Abdel-Fattah issued her own statement, accusing the festival board of “blatant and shameless” anti-Palestinian racism and censorship. She said the board’s attempt to associate her with the Bondi massacre was “despicable”. “The Adelaide Writers Festival Board has stripped me of my humanity and agency, reducing me to an object onto which others can project their racist fears and smears,” she said in the statement. “The Board’s reasoning suggests that my mere presence is ‘culturally insensitive’; that I, a Palestinian who had nothing to do with the Bondi atrocity, am somehow a trigger for those in mourning and that I should therefore be persona non grata in cultural circles because my very presence as a Palestinian is threatening and ‘unsafe’.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Abdel-Fattah also took aim at Australian arts and cultural institutions in general, accusing them of displaying “utter contempt and inhumanity towards Palestinians” since 7 October 2023. “The only Palestinians they will tolerate are silent and invisible ones,” she said. The board said that while it did not suggest “in any way” that Abdel-Fattah or her writings had any connection with the tragedy at Bondi, the decision was made “given her past statements”. “We have formed the view that it would not be culturally sensitive to continue to program her at this unprecedented time so soon after Bondi,” it said. “We understand these Board decisions will likely be disappointing to many in our community. We also recognise our request to Dr Abdel-Fattah will be labelled and will cause discomfort and pressure to other participants. These decisions have not been taken lightly. “Our only request is that our community is respectful to our staff and volunteers who have not formed part of our decision-making process and deserve nothing but ongoing support for their excellent work.” Abdel-Fattah said she was confident that the writing community and public would respond with “principle and integrity, as they did when I was singled out in the same racist way during the Bendigo Writers Festival”. “In the end, the Adelaide Writers Festival will be left with panellists who demonise a Palestinian out of one side of their mouths while waxing lyrical about freedom of speech from the other.” By Thursday afternoon, statements of withdrawal from fellow writers and sponsors started appearing. The Australia Institute announced the withdrawal of its sponsorship for the 2026 event, which in the past had “promoted bravery, freedom of expression and the exchange of ideas”, it said in a statement. “Censoring or cancelling authors is not in the spirit of an open and free exchange of ideas.” A former director of Adelaide Writers’ Week, Jo Dyer, posted on Bluesky that she was “appalled” at the Adelaide festival board’s decision – “a shocking decision that will and should have far-reaching consequences”. The Stella prize-winning poet Evelyn Araluen was one of the first writers to publicly withdraw. The Dropbear and The Rot author said the board’s decision was a “devastating betrayal” of the democratic ethos that has defined the festival. “I am so disappointed to witness yet another absurd and irrational capitulation to the demands of a genocidal foreign state from the Australian arts sector,” she posted on Instagram. “Erasing Palestinians from public life in Australia won’t prevent anti semitism. Removing Palestinians from writers festivals won’t prevent anti semitism. I refuse to participate in this spectacle of censorship.” The First Nations academic and writer Chelsea Watego posted an Adelaide Writers’ Week list of 2026 confirmed writers on Instagram with her name crossed out. Late last year, Abdel-Fattah was cleared of any wrongdoing after an investigation into potential conflicts of interest and spending queries launched amid criticism of her comments on Israel. The Australian Research Council confirmed that a suspension placed on an $870,000 research grant to Abdel-Fattah had been lifted in December. This followed a preliminary investigation by her employer, Macquarie University, launched in early 2025. She had faced sustained criticism from the Coalition, some Jewish bodies and media outlets for controversial comments on Israel, including alleging Zionists had “no claim or right to cultural safety”. The Adelaide festival’s board said its review, undertaken over the past few weeks, had looked at “current and planned operations and interactions through the lens of the current national community context and the role of Adelaide Festival in promoting community cohesion”. “Consideration of the appropriate response to such a tragedy is a human exercise that we understand is subjective in nature,” the board said. “We also understand others will undoubtedly form different judgments.” A subcommittee has been formed by the board to oversee the ongoing review and “guide decisions about Adelaide Writers’ Week in the near and longer terms”, including the appointment of external experts. The board and senior executive will be communicating with all Adelaide Writers’ Week participants in the coming days. More than 150 local and international writers are on the lineup, including the Palestinian poet Najwan Darwish and the Greek economist and political commentator Yanis Varoufakis, who has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ethnic cleansing”. The Adelaide-based publisher Pink Shorts Press said it “strongly condemns” the removal of Abdel-Fattah from programming and was now considering whether it would continue its collaboration with the festival. All its authors were scheduled to speak at the event, and a Pink Shorts Press event was scheduled for the festival grounds. “Adelaide Writers’ Festival has a long and important history of engaging in the conversations that are important to all Australians, and this kind of censorship is completely at odds with that,” the publisher said in a statement. “Abdel-Fattah has contributed so much to multicultural discourse in Australia. Open and challenging discourse within the arts is more important than ever.” Last year, Abdel-Fattah was among about 30 participants who pulled out of the Bendigo writers’ festival after it issued a last-minute code of conduct , including directions to “avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful”. Speakers on panels presented by the festival sponsor La Trobe University were also required to comply with La Trobe’s anti-racism plan, including the contentious definition of antisemitism adopted by Universities Australia in February .

She said the board’s attempt to associate her with the Bondi massacre was “despicable”. “The Adelaide Writers Festival Board has stripped me of my humanity and agency, reducing me to an object onto which others can project their racist fears and smears,” she said in the statement. “The Board’s reasoning suggests that my mere presence is ‘culturally insensitive’; that I, a Palestinian who had nothing to do with the Bondi atrocity, am somehow a trigger for those in mourning and that I should therefore be persona non grata in cultural circles because my very presence as a Palestinian is threatening and ‘unsafe’.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Abdel-Fattah also took aim at Australian arts and cultural institutions in general, accusing them of displaying “utter contempt and inhumanity towards Palestinians” since 7 October 2023. “The only Palestinians they will tolerate are silent and invisible ones,” she said. The board said that while it did not suggest “in any way” that Abdel-Fattah or her writings had any connection with the tragedy at Bondi, the decision was made “given her past statements”. “We have formed the view that it would not be culturally sensitive to continue to program her at this unprecedented time so soon after Bondi,” it said. “We understand these Board decisions will likely be disappointing to many in our community. We also recognise our request to Dr Abdel-Fattah will be labelled and will cause discomfort and pressure to other participants. These decisions have not been taken lightly. “Our only request is that our community is respectful to our staff and volunteers who have not formed part of our decision-making process and deserve nothing but ongoing support for their excellent work.” Abdel-Fattah said she was confident that the writing community and public would respond with “principle and integrity, as they did when I was singled out in the same racist way during the Bendigo Writers Festival”. “In the end, the Adelaide Writers Festival will be left with panellists who demonise a Palestinian out of one side of their mouths while waxing lyrical about freedom of speech from the other.” By Thursday afternoon, statements of withdrawal from fellow writers and sponsors started appearing. The Australia Institute announced the withdrawal of its sponsorship for the 2026 event, which in the past had “promoted bravery, freedom of expression and the exchange of ideas”, it said in a statement. “Censoring or cancelling authors is not in the spirit of an open and free exchange of ideas.” A former director of Adelaide Writers’ Week, Jo Dyer, posted on Bluesky that she was “appalled” at the Adelaide festival board’s decision – “a shocking decision that will and should have far-reaching consequences”. The Stella prize-winning poet Evelyn Araluen was one of the first writers to publicly withdraw. The Dropbear and The Rot author said the board’s decision was a “devastating betrayal” of the democratic ethos that has defined the festival. “I am so disappointed to witness yet another absurd and irrational capitulation to the demands of a genocidal foreign state from the Australian arts sector,” she posted on Instagram. “Erasing Palestinians from public life in Australia won’t prevent anti semitism. Removing Palestinians from writers festivals won’t prevent anti semitism. I refuse to participate in this spectacle of censorship.” The First Nations academic and writer Chelsea Watego posted an Adelaide Writers’ Week list of 2026 confirmed writers on Instagram with her name crossed out. Late last year, Abdel-Fattah was cleared of any wrongdoing after an investigation into potential conflicts of interest and spending queries launched amid criticism of her comments on Israel. The Australian Research Council confirmed that a suspension placed on an $870,000 research grant to Abdel-Fattah had been lifted in December. This followed a preliminary investigation by her employer, Macquarie University, launched in early 2025. She had faced sustained criticism from the Coalition, some Jewish bodies and media outlets for controversial comments on Israel, including alleging Zionists had “no claim or right to cultural safety”. The Adelaide festival’s board said its review, undertaken over the past few weeks, had looked at “current and planned operations and interactions through the lens of the current national community context and the role of Adelaide Festival in promoting community cohesion”. “Consideration of the appropriate response to such a tragedy is a human exercise that we understand is subjective in nature,” the board said. “We also understand others will undoubtedly form different judgments.” A subcommittee has been formed by the board to oversee the ongoing review and “guide decisions about Adelaide Writers’ Week in the near and longer terms”, including the appointment of external experts. The board and senior executive will be communicating with all Adelaide Writers’ Week participants in the coming days. More than 150 local and international writers are on the lineup, including the Palestinian poet Najwan Darwish and the Greek economist and political commentator Yanis Varoufakis, who has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ethnic cleansing”. The Adelaide-based publisher Pink Shorts Press said it “strongly condemns” the removal of Abdel-Fattah from programming and was now considering whether it would continue its collaboration with the festival. All its authors were scheduled to speak at the event, and a Pink Shorts Press event was scheduled for the festival grounds. “Adelaide Writers’ Festival has a long and important history of engaging in the conversations that are important to all Australians, and this kind of censorship is completely at odds with that,” the publisher said in a statement. “Abdel-Fattah has contributed so much to multicultural discourse in Australia. Open and challenging discourse within the arts is more important than ever.” Last year, Abdel-Fattah was among about 30 participants who pulled out of the Bendigo writers’ festival after it issued a last-minute code of conduct , including directions to “avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful”. Speakers on panels presented by the festival sponsor La Trobe University were also required to comply with La Trobe’s anti-racism plan, including the contentious definition of antisemitism adopted by Universities Australia in February .

This litter can be detrimental to the environment and human health: tyres, for example, contain zinc and other heavy metals that can be toxic to ecosystems in high concentrations. “Even natural, less persistent materials, such as worked wood, paper, cardboard and food waste may contain toxic or harmful additives,” said Dr Leandra Hamann, a zoologist at the University of Bonn and lead author of the study.

Researchers said the composition of litter found in the Rhine was very similar to that found in other European rivers including the Thames. These large quantities of litter also have the potential to damage crucial infrastructure such as drainage systems, leading to increased risk of flooding. Citizen scientists and researchers from the University of Bonn analysed litter collected from the Rhine between November 2022 and November 2023.

In unusually strong and apparently uncoordinated remarks, Emmanuel Macron and Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the postwar rules-based international order could soon disintegrate. “The US is an established power, but one that is gradually turning away from some of its allies and breaking free from the very international rules that it was until recently promoting,” Macron told France’s diplomatic corps at the Élysée Palace on Thursday. “Multilateral institutions are functioning less and less effectively,” the French president said. “We are living in a world of great powers, with a real temptation to divide up the world.” He said France “rejects the new colonialism and new imperialism – but also vassalage and defeatism. What we have achieved for France and in Europe is a step in the right direction. Greater strategic autonomy, less dependence on the US and China.” The comments came as EU leaders – torn between the needs to defend international law and to keep the US onboard as a vital economic partner and defence ally in Ukraine and beyond – struggle to agree a coordinated response to Washington’s actions. While neither president said so directly, both were widely presumed to be referring to last weekend’s US raid on Caracas and capture of the Venezuelan leader , Nicolás Maduro, and to Trump’s repeatedly stated aim of taking control of Greenland . Steinmeier, speaking on Wednesday night at a symposium in Berlin to mark his 70th birthday, said global democracy was at risk. The former German foreign minister said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a watershed, but subsequent US behaviour marked a second “epochal rupture”. There had been a “breakdown of values by our most important partner, the US, which helped build this world order”, he said. “It is about preventing the world from turning into a robber’s den, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.” Steinmeier said the erosion of the world order had already reached an advanced stage. Smaller, weaker states risked becoming “completely defenceless”, and entire regions could be treated “as the property of a few great powers”. He said European security policy needed to be revised as a consequence. “We must not be weak,” he said, adding that Germany could only play a role “if we are taken seriously, also militarily”, so this was “the goal we have to achieve”. Macron in his speech also stressed the importance of safeguarding academic independence and “a controlled information space, where opinions can be exchanged completely freely, but where choices are not made by the algorithms of a few”. He said the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which covers competition, and the Digital Services Act (DSA) on content moderation – which the US has denounced as an attempt to “coerce” its tech giants into censorship – “must be defended”.

Districts in the south-west of the German capital were gradually returning to normal after the longest power cut since the second world war as Wegner acknowledged he had not been entirely forthcoming about his actions when the outage began. Leftwing militants claimed responsibility for the attack on Saturday that deliberately cut the electricity to about 45,000 households and more than 2,000 businesses, and raised troubling questions about German preparedness for sabotage. Wegner confirmed a report by the public broadcaster RBB that he had been on a tennis court that day with his partner, the Berlin education minister, Katharina Günther-Wünsch, between 1 and 2pm. Wegner, from the conservative Christian Democratic Union party of the chancellor, Friedrich Merz , had told reporters on Sunday that he had been working round the clock to mitigate the impact of the blackout and get the power back on. “I was neither bored nor putting my feet up, but was on the phone all day trying to coordinate and get as much information as possible,” he said,and had “literally locked myself in my office at home”. Late on Wednesday he acknowledged his choice of words had been sub-par. “Looking back, I should have said on Sunday what I did on Saturday,” he said. “Yes, at some point I said: ‘I need a short break, I need to clear my head.’ And the best way for me to do that is with sport.” Eight months before a regional election in which Wegner is expected to stand again, a growing chorus said he had lost the authority to stay in office. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland, which has been rising in the polls in Berlin , said it was “bad enough the Berlin mayor does not take an emergency situation caused by a terrorist attack on the city’s infrastructure seriously enough to cancel his tennis match”. Wegner also “lied to the people of Berlin’s faces”, said Kristin Brinker, the AfD regional parliamentary group leader. Steffen Krach, the mayoral candidate from the Social Democrats, junior partners in Wegner’s ruling coalition, deemed the mayor’s actions “unacceptable” and “unworthy” of his office. Wegner met CDU lawmakers in Berlin early on Thursday and asked for their support given the “extremely difficult situation in the press” , the local newspaper BZ reported. The swirling scandal recalled the resignation last year of Carlos Mazón as the president of the eastern Spanish region of Valencia after it emerged he had spent more than three hours having lunch with a journalist in 2024 as devastating floods that killed 229 people hit the area. Others saw echoes of a lapse of judgment by Armin Laschet, the CDU frontrunner to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor in the 2021 election, who was forced to apologise after appearing to joke with officials while visiting a community stricken by deadly flash floods. He lost the chancellorship two months later to Olaf Scholz . The Wegner affair was quickly nicknamed “tennis-gate”, with the prominent Greens MP Ricarda Lang drily noting on X: “At least Kai Wegner had a net on Saturday.” In German, Netz (net) can also mean a mobile phone signal, something tens of thousands of Berliners were without for more than four days. Another meme played on Liz Truss’s brief tenure and the 2022 tabloid stunt asking who would last longer, the then British prime minister or a decaying lettuce.

The farmers blockaded motorways outside Paris on Thursday and dozens of tractors overran police checkpoints to reach the city centre in a pre-dawn protest organised by the Coordination Rurale union. EU states are due to vote on Friday on the deal with Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, the four members of the South American trade bloc known as Mercosur. If ratified, it would create a common market of nearly 800 million people, boosting EU exports of vehicles, machinery, wines and spirits. Many European farmers fear being undercut by an influx of cheaper agricultural products from the Mercosur common market. Belgian farmers have also protested, rolling more than 1,000 tractors into Brussels last month. “We are between resentment and despair. We have a feeling of abandonment – with Mercosur being an example,” Stéphane Pelletier, a senior member of Coordination Rurale, told Reuters beneath the Eiffel Tower. The French government said authorities would “not stand by”. Blocking roads or “attempting to gather in front of parliament – with all the symbolism that entails – is, once again, illegal”, the government spokesperson Maud Bregeon told French radio. Surrounded by a heavy police presence, farmers also demonstrated in front of French parliament’s lower house, heckling the national assembly president, Yaël Braun-Pivet, when she came out to meet them. The Mercosur deal is backed by Germany and Spain but France , mindful of its powerful farming lobby, has long been fiercely opposed. Paris has won significant last-minute concessions but, with municipal elections due in March, remains wary of the deal. “The treaty is still not acceptable,” Bregeon said, declining to say how Emmanuel Macron would vote. The farming minister, Annie Genevard, said that even if it was approved, France would continue to oppose it in the European parliament. The two blocs have held negotiations over the deal for the past 26 years, with talks given added momentum by the Trump administration’s protectionist agenda and the rapidly growing impact of competition from China. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, finally signed the accord in late 2024, despite opposition from France, Poland and a couple smaller states, but it has yet to be ratified by EU member states and parliament. The free trade accord aims to cut South American tariffs on European cars, clothes, food, fine wines and medicines. In exchange, the EU will open its markets, although it has set limits on imports of beef, pork, ethanol, honey and sugar. In an attempt to win over member states, the commission this week proposed making an extra €45bn of EU funding available to farmers in the bloc’s next seven-year budget, largely offsetting a planned 20% cut in agricultural funding. France still has demands, including tougher safeguards allowing the EU to reimpose trade tariffs if prices fall by 5%, rather than the 8% stipulated in the accord. It also seeks permission to ban imports of crops grown with pesticides, which are banned in the EU. However, the commission’s latest offer appears to have won over Italy, whose support was long uncertain. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, this week hailed what she called a “commonsense approach to supporting European agriculture”. While Rome is also believed to still be pushing for tougher price safeguards, analysts believe Italy’s apparent backing should now allow the deal to be approved by a qualified majority of member states on Friday, with or without French support. Under the qualified majority system, the votes of 15 of the EU’s 27 states – representing 65% of its population – are needed for the accord to be approved. It could be blocked by at least four countries representing 35% or more of the EU’s population. Without the 13% of the bloc’s population represented by what is, in effect, Italy’s casting vote, France – whose opposition to the accord is shared by Ireland, Austria and Poland – seems unlikely to have the numbers to block it.

The Mercosur deal is backed by Germany and Spain but France , mindful of its powerful farming lobby, has long been fiercely opposed. Paris has won significant last-minute concessions but, with municipal elections due in March, remains wary of the deal. “The treaty is still not acceptable,” Bregeon said, declining to say how Emmanuel Macron would vote. The farming minister, Annie Genevard, said that even if it was approved, France would continue to oppose it in the European parliament. The two blocs have held negotiations over the deal for the past 26 years, with talks given added momentum by the Trump administration’s protectionist agenda and the rapidly growing impact of competition from China. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, finally signed the accord in late 2024, despite opposition from France, Poland and a couple smaller states, but it has yet to be ratified by EU member states and parliament. The free trade accord aims to cut South American tariffs on European cars, clothes, food, fine wines and medicines. In exchange, the EU will open its markets, although it has set limits on imports of beef, pork, ethanol, honey and sugar. In an attempt to win over member states, the commission this week proposed making an extra €45bn of EU funding available to farmers in the bloc’s next seven-year budget, largely offsetting a planned 20% cut in agricultural funding. France still has demands, including tougher safeguards allowing the EU to reimpose trade tariffs if prices fall by 5%, rather than the 8% stipulated in the accord. It also seeks permission to ban imports of crops grown with pesticides, which are banned in the EU. However, the commission’s latest offer appears to have won over Italy, whose support was long uncertain. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, this week hailed what she called a “commonsense approach to supporting European agriculture”. While Rome is also believed to still be pushing for tougher price safeguards, analysts believe Italy’s apparent backing should now allow the deal to be approved by a qualified majority of member states on Friday, with or without French support. Under the qualified majority system, the votes of 15 of the EU’s 27 states – representing 65% of its population – are needed for the accord to be approved. It could be blocked by at least four countries representing 35% or more of the EU’s population. Without the 13% of the bloc’s population represented by what is, in effect, Italy’s casting vote, France – whose opposition to the accord is shared by Ireland, Austria and Poland – seems unlikely to have the numbers to block it.

On Tuesday, Britain and France said they would be ready to send troops to Ukraine after a peace deal, but the Reform UK leader said he would vote against any such move to put boots on the ground. Farage’s comments cast doubt on his commitment to the UK’s national security, the cabinet minister Pat McFadden said. He accused the politician of taking a pro-Russia stance on the issue, which he said should give voters “pause for thought”. “This guarantee is not just for Ukraine , it’s for the whole of Europe,” he said. “It’s in the British national interest that we do that, and that’s why it’s so concerning to me to see some politicians, like Mr Farage, for example, immediately come out [and] parrot the Kremlin line and say that he wouldn’t support this.” Farage faced criticism for “not really [being] an MP at all” on Wednesday after choosing to appear on Times Radio instead of attending prime minister’s questions in the Commons. During the broadcast he criticised Starmer’s Ukraine policy and said he would vote against any proposal to deploy troops to the country. “It would be a very interesting vote. I would vote against,” said Farage, who is one of five Reform MPs. “We neither have the manpower nor the equipment to go into an operation that clearly has no ending timeline.” He added: “If the coalition of the willing was eight, 10, a dozen countries and we could rotate battalions through then I might well say, ‘Yeah, absolutely let’s do it’. As it is, it will be us and the French completely exposed for an unlimited period of time.” Farage’s comments came after a summit on Tuesday of more than two dozen leaders of the states that make up the “coalition of the willing” of Ukrainian allies, plus the US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron signed a declaration of intent with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy , in Paris, and said they were committed to deploying ground troops to Ukraine. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Starmer said MPs would have a debate and vote before any UK troops were deployed on peacekeeping duties. Farage’s stance on Russia has become a key Labour attack line against Reform, in particular since the jailing of the party’s former leader in Wales Nathan Gill in last November for taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia when he was an MEP. In the past, Farage has spoken of his admiration for Putin as a political operator and repeatedly warned the west against “ poking the Russian bear with a stick ”, accusing the EU of provoking the war in Ukraine in 2024. After criticism, he wrote in the Telegraph that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was “immoral, outrageous and indefensible” but added: “[I]f you have neither the means nor the political will to face him down, poking a bear is obviously not good foreign policy.” A Labour spokesperson said Farage’s comments were the “behaviour of Putin’s puppet”. They said: “Nigel Farage’s equivocation on support for Ukraine is an insult to those who have fought to defend freedom. “When Farage shrugs at support for Ukraine, a country that has been brutally invaded, people are entitled to ask who he is really speaking for, because this is not patriotism, it’s the behaviour of Putin’s puppet.” Nigel Farage Labour Russia Vladimir Putin Pat McFadden Reform UK Foreign policy news","Farage accused of ‘parroting Kremlin lines’ after remarks on UK troops in Ukraine Pat McFadden says stance on potential peace deployment casts doubt on Reform leader’s commitment to national security UK politics live – latest updates UK politics live – latest updates Nigel Farage has been accused of “parroting Kremlin lines” after saying that he would vote against any UK government plans to deploy the military in Ukraine.

The Syrian government urged people to leave the three contested neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud, Ashrafieh and Bani Zeid by early afternoon, opening humanitarian corridors and displacement shelters to facilitate their exit. The Syrian army said it would begin military operations against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after the deadline, and issued maps showing specific areas that needed to be evacuated. Shortly after the deadline expired at 1.30pm local time (1030 GMT) the Syrian government began shelling, with the SDF firing as well. The clashes are the most intense fighting in Syria since the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, and sparked fears of a broader conflict between the Syrian government and the well-armed Kurdish authorities who control much of north-east Syria – nearly a third of Syrian territory. Despite an agreement for the SDF to merge into the Syrian army by the start of 2025, clashes have continued to erupt between it and the government. This week’s three days of fighting is the longest open conflict between the two sides since the agreement was signed in March 2025. About 140,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting since it started on Tuesday, according to the directorate of social affairs and labour in Aleppo. At least eight civilians have been killed in the Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods, and seven civilians and one soldier killed in government-controlled areas. Dozens more have been wounded on both sides. The SDF currently controls the Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods in Aleppo but on Wednesday the Syrian government announced its intention to push out Kurdish fighters from all of Aleppo city, in a move likely to exacerbate tensions between it and the Kurdish bloc in the north-east. The SDF denies having any fighters in the neighbourhoods, instead describing them as local self-defence forces. Both sides accused the other of human rights violations, with the Syrian government claiming the SDF used civilians as human shields, not letting them evacuate and shooting at them when they tried. The SDF shared videos of what it said were government forces shelling a hospital in Aleppo, as well of what it called “brutal artillery shelling” targeting populated residential areas in Sheikh Maqsoud. Many displaced people fled to other provinces of Syria, but some did not have the means to travel and sheltered in nearby mosques and churches. At the root of the conflict are continuing disagreements about the status of the SDF in post-Assad Syria. It controls nearly a third of the country and has been a partner of US forces in their anti-Islamic State mission in Syria. Under the 10 March agreement, the SDF is meant to integrate fully into the new Syrian army. However, disagreements over how exactly that integration would take place have stalled progress. The SDF is seeking autonomy under the government, and after massacres on Syria’s coast and Druze-majority areas – in which some government-backed forces committed human rights violations against civilians – it has become more bullish on retaining its weapons. Some of the factions that make up the new Syrian army have been fighting the SDF for years and there is bitter enmity between them. A meeting on Sunday between Damascus and the SDF yielded no new progress on implementing the agreement, despite the deadline expiring. There is growing distrust on both sides, which has been worsened by fighting and a lack of progress in negotiations. Supporters of the government were outraged as pictures of civilians allegedly killed by SDF shelling circulated on social media, while thousands of protesters gathered in Qamishli, the de-facto capital of the SDF-controlled areas in north-east Syria, in solidarity with the SDF. Describing Syrian government forces as “jihadists”, Farhad Shami, a spokesperson for the SDF, said on Thursday afternoon that fighting in Aleppo “opened the door to the expansion of the war into other areas”. A US state department official on Thursday urged restraint on all sides, and said the US envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, was trying to mediate between the two sides. “All parties should focus on how to build a peaceful, stable Syria that protects and serves the interests of all Syrians, rather than pushing the country back into a cycle of violence,” the state department official said in a statement. The US has tried to maintain a balancing act between its longtime Kurdish allies in Syria and the new authorities in Damascus, to which it has grown closer. The SDF views US support and its continued military presence as a safeguard against Turkey, which has carried out three invasions against it. Turkey considers the SDF a Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist group with which it has fought a four decades-long insurgency. The Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, called the SDF the “biggest obstacle to peace in Syria” on Thursday, while the Turkish defence ministry said it would provide military aid to the government in Damascus if requested.

The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen said Aidarous al-Zubaidi had fled the port city of Aden for Abu Dhabi under Emirati supervision, deepening a diplomatic row between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Saudis said al-Zubaidi travelled first by boat to the Emirati-owned port of Berbera in Somaliland, before boarding an aircraft to Mogadishu that was later tracked to a military airport in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. Sources in al-Zubaidi’s Southern Transitional Council did not dispute the fact of his escape. The crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia erupted last month when UAE-backed separatists swept through southern Yemen and reached the border with Saudi Arabia, which declared the move a threat to its national security. For years, the US allies had fought together in Yemen against the Iran-backed Houthis , before a 2022 ceasefire that left the Houthis in control of a chunk of north-western Yemen. The Saudis back Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, which oversees Yemen’s internationally recognised government, and on Wednesday expelled al-Zubaidi and charged him with treason after he failed to fly to Riyadh for talks. His flight puts a disastrous end to the now internally divided STC drive to declare southern Yemen a separate state and push out forces loyal to the internationally recognised government. The aim had been to return to the north-south split that prevailed prior to unification in 1990. In recent days, al-Zubaidi’s aides had vowed he would fight to retain Aden – long an STC stronghold – or retreat to conduct a guerilla campaign, but it appears plans for a late-night exile were already under way, and that splits emerging in the STC made his position untenable. He is said to have fled with some of his closest supporters in the government. The Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government’s ministry of information demanded international sanctions be placed on al-Zubaidi. It said: “Al-Zubaidi would not have acted with such recklessness without direction from Abu Dhabi … where he placed his personal interests and the interests of his supporters above the interests of the nation.” Saudi Arabia’s willingness to highlight the Emirati role in al-Zubaidi’s escape shows the continued anger in Riyadh at the Emirati role in backing the STC rebellion. On Tuesday night, al-Zubaidi had, at the last minute, refused a Saudi ultimatum to fly from Aden to Riyadh for talks, a move that angered the Saudis so much that they bombed an STC military camp. He apparently had reached the airport but did not board the plane, before returning to his home in Aden and then fleeing. A more than 50-strong STC delegation did fly from Aden to Riyadh. Members of the delegation said they were safe and that they had held constructive talks. It was not clear how free the delegation were to speak. The STC’s grip on Aden had been weakened by internal splits when Abdulrahman Al-Muharami, a commander of the Giants Brigades, issued orders to withdraw heavy weapons from military camps and to impose security control over commanders linked to al-Zubaidi’s Al-Dhala wing. The split made it easier for Saudi-backed forces to enter Aden. Leaders of the Saudi-backed government had left the city for Saudi Arabia when the STC took control last month. The disarray confirms the scale of the military and political overreach that has created a disaster for the southern movement. Three weeks ago, in a bid to control the entire south of Yemen, a confident STC poured into two previously independent-minded eastern governorates: Hadramaut and Al-Mahra. In a televised address on 2 January, al-Zubaidi declared a two-year transitional period leading to a self-determination referendum for the “State of South Arabia” within the borders of the former People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, which was independent from 1967 to 1990. The advance angered Saudi Arabia, which used limited airstrikes and loyal local militia to force an STC withdrawal , provoking a wider collapse in STC support across the south. The UAE, diplomatically isolated, ended its military support for the STC initiative, a critical factor in the STC withdrawal. Abu Dhabi removed its military equipment and assets from bases and camps in Hadramaut, Shabwa, Aden, and the West Coast. It is not clear whether the Saudi diplomats back in the driving seat are sincere in saying they want to listen to the longstanding demands of the separatists, or will instead back calls to repress not just the STC for insurrection and treason but also the cause that it had led. Saudi Arabia has promised to stage a southern dialogue. The separatist cause has long been supported by the UAE, creating friction with Riyadh . Saudi Arabia shares a border with Yemen and opposes the fracturing of Yemen, preferring instead to focus on uniting the multiple Yemeni factions and tribes to try to drive the Houthis out.

Protesters took to the streets across Kurdish cities in western Iran, with shopkeepers shutting down stores and demonstrators chanting against government corruption. People said they were met with force as authorities fired teargas, pellet guns and what demonstrators said were live bullets at crowds. “They are killing us. They’re showing no mercy. In Kermanshah, we’ve all come out, we’re all under pressure. At noon in the square they beat a woman so badly she couldn’t stand up. I’m begging all the people of Iran, let’s all rise up together,” said a 35-year-old female protester in the Mossadegh area of, Kermanshah, a Kurdish city in western Iran, her voice breaking over the crackle of gunfire as she spoke. Demonstrations are continuing to spread across Iran as the protest movement, initially sparked by a sudden nosedive in the value of the Iranian rial, enters its 11th day. Though increasing in size , they have not yet reached the size of previous movements such as the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests, which saw popular anger erupt after the 22-year-old woman died in police custody. Initially sparked by economic conditions and led at first by traders, the demonstrations have since expanded to address grievances of the public towards the government, particularly as its crackdown intensifies. Videos showed students at Kermanshah University calling for the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, while other videos showed protesters resisting teargas shot by authorities to disperse them. Seven Iranian Kurdish opposition parties called for a general strike on Thursday, while Pahlavi also called for unified protests across the country on the same day. “[The strike] will send an important signal to the entire country: that the resistance in Kurdistan is standing strong and that people are ready to continue. This is a peaceful action, and we sincerely hope that people will not be attacked,” said Hiwa Bahrami, the head of foreign relations for the Democratic party of Iranian Kurdistan. Two separate protesters from Kermanshah told the Guardian they had witnessed security forces shooting at protesters. The eyewitness testimony was confirmed by the Norway-based Hengaw organisation for human rights, which said it had documented the use of Kalashnikov rifles against protesters on Wednesday. At least 36 people, including four children and two members of Iran’s security forces, have been killed in the violence surrounding protests, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists news agency (Hrana). More than 2,100 people have been arrested so far, according to the agency, with a spate of detentions of Kurdish protesters on Wednesday. Iran’s government has thus far taken a carrot-and-stick approach to the protests, with public servants offering dialogue and economic reform while security forces have struck a more defiant tone. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has ordered investigations into videos which show riot-gear clad security forces raiding a hospital in Ilam, and his government announced the doubling of a state subsidy for breadwinners across the country. The new subsidy, which would provide £5.20 a month, is meant to ease the soaring price of basic goods such as food and medicine. At the same time, the head of Iran’s army warned the military would not sit idly by as international powers threatened to strike Iran in aid of protesters, and would take pre-emptive action. The US president, Donald Trump, had said last week that the US would come to the rescue of protesters if Iran’s government shot and killed them – a threat that has grown more alarming for Iran since the US capture of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, on Saturday. “The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,” said Maj Gen Amir Hatami, according to Iranian state media. He said while protests were normal, the transformation of demonstrations into riots was “undoubtedly planned by the enemies”. As demonstrations continue, the economic conditions which initially triggered them worsen. The nation’s currency is depreciating, and traders have warned the price of basic goods would soar after the government announced it would cancel a programme which allowed importers and producers to use a preferential exchange rate for certain goods. The people of Iran have suffered for years due to economic mismanagement and some of the world’s harshest sanctions being placed on the country. Iran’s currency has lost two-thirds of its value in the last three years while the prices of basic goods have continued to increase. The average price of food had increased by 72% over the last year. The government has acknowledged the population’s economic woe, but has said further belt-tightening would be necessary, blaming the crisis on external factors. The vice-president, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, said on Wednesday that Iran was in a “full-fledged economic war”, calling for the elimination of corruption and price-gouging within the country. Despite the escalating violence, protesters said they intended to stay on the streets and respond to the calls for protests tomorrow. Families of demonstrators killed during the 2022 protests said they had been instructed by the intelligence services not to join protests tomorrow. “They are shooting at anyone and everyone. We are united with the rest of the people across [Iran]. They stood by us in 2022 and will stand by them this time. Tomorrow is the day all the Kurdish people will be on the streets,” said Soran, from Kermanshah, speaking under a pseudonym.

Al-Zubaidi, the president of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), has been gathering his remaining troops in Aden as rival Saudi-backed forces seek to take control of Aden. His supporters said his mood was to fight it out although he knew it was likely there would be an attempt to kill him. The UN-recognised government of national unity that supports the retention of a unified Yemen has accused him of high treason for unilaterally raising the flag of independence for southern Yemen. A former military leader turned politician, he was sacked from the government’s presidential leadership council as a result. Al-Zubaidi’s refusal to travel to Riyadh on Tuesday night, defying a demand from the Saudi defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, prompted Saudi Arabia to launch airstrikes on his remaining military camps in his stronghold in the Zubaid area of Dhale region. One of al-Zubaidi’s advisers, Amr Al-Bidah, told a briefing: “Al-Zubaidi is on the ground in Aden conducting his duties,” saying there would be chaos if Saudi-backed forces tried to capture the city as was being threatened. Al-Bidah said: “Al-Zubaidi was told: ‘Either you come to Riyadh or we bomb you, and that is your last chance.’ That does not create a conducive atmosphere for dialogue.” Al-Zubaidi’s village is being bombed by the Saudis and so far about 14 civilians have been injured and two killed. There had also been concerns that if al-Zubaidi travelled to Riyadh, he would be arrested. A 50-strong STC delegation that did fly to Riyadh for talks had not been contactable, al-Bidah said, explaining: “They arrived at 3am and observers told us that they took them to a black bus. Their phones are ringing but no one is picking up. It is very worrying.” Yemen’s deputy foreign minister, Awsan al-Aud, said: “Through its rebellion, the STC has become a banned entity. The ongoing battle will not last long. The STC has to be dismantled, or at the very least, it will have to give up arms and become a political organisation only.” Al-Zubaidi’s unilateral attempt to unfurl the flag of independence for southern Yemen started to collapse once his external backers the United Arab Emirates deserted him after it became clear that Saudi Arabia was willing to use force not just against the STC to prevent Yemen’s fragmentation, but also against UAE arms supplies reaching Yemen through the port city of Mukalla. After carefully extending his base beyond Aden over the past three years, al-Zubaidi in early December took the unilateral step of sending tens of thousands of well-equipped troops into the eastern governorates of oil-rich Hadramaut and al-Mahrah, bordering Oman. With Saudi Arabia hesitating militarily, and the UAE backing the STC, large-scale pro-independence demonstrations were held in the capital of Hadramaut. Codenamed Operation Promising Future, the campaign’s swift territorial gains – and the apparent popular support – meant that by 9 December the STC had taken control of most areas spanning the six governorates of the former southern Yemen. The turning point came when on 30 December, the royal Saudi air force carried out airstrikes on the STC-controlled Mukalla, targeting what it said was a shipment of weapons that had arrived from the UAE. Abu Dhabi denied that the shipments contained weapons, but the UN-recognised Yemeni government ordered all UAE forces to leave Yemeni territory within 24 hours, announcing a 72-hour air, land, and sea blockade, and declared a 90-day state of emergency. Saudi Arabia also assembled a large Gulf diplomatic alliance to oppose the splitting of Yemen, saying such a split would weaken the fight against the Houthis in northern Yemen. Later that day, the UAE announced it would voluntarily withdraw its remaining counter-terrorist forces from Yemen, but in reality it also removed much of the command and control structure it had been providing to the STC, hobbling the council’s operation. The withdrawal has resulted in the Saudi-backed forces regaining Hadramaut and al-Mahrah. At the weekend a previously STC-oriented Shabwah governorate returned to the STC fold, signalling the full-scale collapse of the revolt. Late last week the UAE in effect advised the STC it was on its own in future, ending more than six years of cooperation. In his letter to al-Zubaidi summoning him to visit, Prince Khaled said he wanted to “hear directly from you, ‘What happened?’ and what are the justifications for what occurred?” It adds: “You and the Prince must reconcile, meet, and engage in a serious, brotherly discussion so that he clearly understands the justifications for your military operation and your position in Hadramaut and al-Mahra, and this matter is closed. “The Prince will discuss with you the Transitional Council’s needs in full, including its forces, operational mechanisms, and communication channels. The Kingdom has assumed responsibility for this file following the UAE’s withdrawal. “The Prince will discuss with you future coordination and cooperation, both at the southern level and regarding the overall solution and the Yemeni situation. Any delay or failure to respond to the invitation to come to Riyadh, or any procrastination in doing so, will have serious consequences.” The UAE has been backing the separatist STC since its formation in 2017 partly because it was seen as a bulwark against Muslim Brotherhood and Salifist forces inside Yemen, but also because the STC was seen as a route for Abu Dhabi to control Red Sea ports. The STC under UAE influence had also shown a willingness to cooperate with Israel. Saudi Arabia, which shares a border with Yemen, opposes Yemen’s fragmentation, believing it will weaken the fight against the Houthis that control the north of Yemen. The UAE, finding itself isolated over Yemen, is now likely to review its strategy elsewhere in the region including in Sudan where it has been backing a different faction to Riyadh.

The violence on Tuesday at a location that carries historical symbolism as an activist hub during the country’s 1979 revolution comes as rights groups accuse authorities of cracking down on protesters. At least 35 people have been killed in clashes surrounding the protests – which began over the state of the economy and rising prices – and more than 1,200 others arrested by security forces, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists news agency (HRNA). In one instance, in Illam province, south-west of Tehran, video showed security forces in riot gear streaming into a hospital in search of protesters. Despite the violence, protests showed no signs of slowing, with demonstrations in at least 257 locations in 88 cities across the country, according to HRNA data. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, told protesters on Tuesday that much of the economic situation was out of the government’s hands, warning that any intervention may only worsen already spiralling inflation. “The government basically does not have such power. Even if it wants to do this, it will be forced to put heavy pressure on the lower deciles of society by printing money. The country’s income is certain and our resources aren’t unlimited,” Pezeshkian said in a speech on Tuesday. The dwindling purchasing power that first triggered the protests has continued to decline, with the Iranian rial dropping to a historic low of 1.46m to the US dollar. The currency has lost about two-thirds of its value in the past three years and its nosedive has accelerated in recent months. Iran’s central bank has meanwhile said as the currency falls that it would curb a programme to businesses that gives a preferential exchange rate on dollars – a move that is likely to lead to further price increases and shortages for consumers. An end to subsidised exchange could further exacerbate shortages in Iranian grocery stores. Iran’s state news agency said the average price of a bottle of cooking oil had recently doubled in price, while other goods are simply unavailable as traders hoard products in anticipation of further inflation. Pezeshian said the government may have to tighten its belt, blaming worsening economic conditions on sanctions, saying “oil is under embargo and sources of income are limited”. The president said the government would open an investigation into allegations of security forces’ violence against protesters in Illam province. He also mentioned “an incident in a hospital in the city of Illam”, referencing the footage of officers raiding a hospital there. The videos were directly referenced by the US state department, which said that “beating medical staff and attacking the wounded with teargas and ammunition is a clear crime against humanity”, in a post on X from its Farsi-language account. The Iranian government has been toeing a careful line between an all-out crackdown on protesters and appearing lax, offering dialogue while security forces carried out arrests and at times appeared to use violence against demonstrators. The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Saturday that the demands of protesters were legitimate, but that rioters among the demonstrators should be “put in their place”. The state-aligned Fars news agency said 250 police officers and 45 members of the volunteer paramilitary Basij force were injured in the demonstrations. Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if the government kills protesters, a comment that drew angry warnings from top Iranian officials. The US threat carried extra weight after the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was captured and brought to New York by US forces on Saturday.

The president said the government would open an investigation into allegations of security forces’ violence against protesters in Illam province. He also mentioned “an incident in a hospital in the city of Illam”, referencing the footage of officers raiding a hospital there. The videos were directly referenced by the US state department, which said that “beating medical staff and attacking the wounded with teargas and ammunition is a clear crime against humanity”, in a post on X from its Farsi-language account. The Iranian government has been toeing a careful line between an all-out crackdown on protesters and appearing lax, offering dialogue while security forces carried out arrests and at times appeared to use violence against demonstrators. The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Saturday that the demands of protesters were legitimate, but that rioters among the demonstrators should be “put in their place”. The state-aligned Fars news agency said 250 police officers and 45 members of the volunteer paramilitary Basij force were injured in the demonstrations. Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if the government kills protesters, a comment that drew angry warnings from top Iranian officials. The US threat carried extra weight after the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was captured and brought to New York by US forces on Saturday.

Investigators from India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) claim Harjeet Singh and his wife, Jyoti Awasthi, co-founders of Satat Sampada (Nature Forever), were paid almost £500,000 to advocate for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty (FFNPT). The ED is a law enforcement agency that operates under India’s ministry of finance and is responsible for enforcing economic laws and investigating financial crimes. In a statement , the agency said it had carried out searches at Singh’s home and Satat Sampada properties “as part of an ongoing investigation into suspicious foreign inward remittances received in the garb of consultancy charges” from climate campaign groups, “which have in turn received huge funds from prior reference category NGOs like Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors”. “However, cross-verification of filings made by the remitters abroad indicates that the funds were actually intended to promote the agenda of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty within India,” the agency said. The FFNPT Initiative is an international campaign calling for a treaty to stop exploration for new fossil fuels and to gradually phase out their use. First endorsed by the Pacific Island nations of Vanuatu and Tuvalu, it has the support of 17 national governments, the World Health Organization and the European parliament, as well as a constellation of civil society figures. The ED officers said: “While presented as a climate initiative, its adoption could expose India to legal challenges in international forums like the international court of justice (ICJ) and severely compromise the nation’s energy security and economic development.” They said that in the course of their search they found a large cache of whiskey, above legal limits, at Singh’s home in Delhi and they told local police, who subsequently arrested and then bailed him on Monday night. The agency said it was investigating trips Singh made to Pakistan and Bangladesh last year, including how they were funded. Singh and Awasthi said in a statement that they were prevented from sharing details of the case for legal reasons, but added: “We categorically state that the allegations being reported are baseless, biased and misleading.” Singh is a familiar figure at Cop climate negotiations, having worked for more than two decades with international NGOs and climate campaigns including ActionAid and the Climate Action Network. Civil society organisations in India under Narendra Modi have faced severe pressures. Almost 17,000 licences to receive foreign funding have been suspended and a large number of civil society organisations have shut down. According to an unnamed ED officer quoted by the Hindustan Times , the investigation into Singh began on the basis of intelligence received from Cop30, held in Belém, Brazil, last November. Other activists “whose climate campaigns may be inimical to India’s energy security” were also being investigated, another unnamed officer was quoted as saying. The ED accused Singh of running Satat Sampada as a front, publicly projecting itself as a company marketing organic produce while its “primary activity appears to be channelling foreign funds to run narratives furthering the FFNPT cause in India, on behalf of foreign influencer groups”. The agency said the company had been running at a loss until 2021 when payments from campaign groups, registered as “consultancy services” and “agro-product sales”, turned its fortunes around. “The ED suspects misdeclaration and misrepresentation of the nature and purpose of the foreign funds received by SSPL. The agency is investigating the full extent of the suspected violations … and whether the activities funded were against the national interest, specifically India’s energy security,” it said. Singh and Awasthi said they started Satat Sampada with their own savings and loans secured on their home in 2016, and that the organisation’s consultancy and management services grew in 2021 after Singh left his full-time employment to focus more on its work. “His work and contributions are well documented across print, digital, television and social media, as well as public platforms,” they said.

In 2019, Sajid Javid, then home secretary, stripped the Londoner of her UK citizenship on the grounds that she was a security threat, having travelled as a schoolgirl with two friends to territory controlled by Islamic State (IS) in Syria. At the time, 76% of people backed the move . Fast-forward to November 2025, and an equivalent poll found two-thirds of people thought Begum should not be allowed back to the UK . In policy terms, therefore, responding to the European court of human rights’ intervention in the matter should be a no-brainer for the Home Office. This week, media briefings suggested Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, would “robustly” push back against the court after it questioned whether the UK should have considered if Begum – who left the country aged 15 – had been trafficked before it left her stateless in a Syrian camp. It is not, however, a subject that ministers can simply ignore, for two reasons in particular. The first is that Begum is not alone. In November, a report into counter-terrorism by a commission of senior UK lawyers said the government’s refusal to repatriate most of the several dozen Britons still living in camps for former IS members and their families was becoming “untenable”. It said that between 55 and 72 people with links to the UK remain in the camps, among them about 30 to 40 children, living in “inhuman” and often dangerous conditions, and added that other countries have already taken action on the issue. The second reason – for all that Mahmood might dismiss it – is that the human rights court might have a point. Even if one was to argue that the 15-year-old Begum was old enough to understand the implications of seeking out a self-styled global caliphate that has carried out numerous and atrocious rights abuses , the UK has never sought to hold her to account. Nor has it sought to take responsibility for the actions of someone who, when she left the UK, was entirely a product of her home country. Begum’s case also highlights another political quandary, which is not currently high on the list of voters’ concerns, but has potentially huge repercussions: what does it mean for the rights of Britons who have migrant heritage? Ministers were able to strip Begum of her UK citizenship only because they said she was entitled to Bangladeshi nationality through her parents. Bangladesh, however, has rejected this . Citizenship cannot be revoked if it leaves someone stateless, meaning Begum’s fate would have been impossible for an equivalent Briton without an overseas background. The bar for losing UK nationality is set high. It can only happen if citizenship was acquired fraudulently, or if removing it is “conducive to the public good”. Home Office guidance specifies this as meaning the affected person is connected to serious organised crime, terrorism or war crimes. It is for these reasons that the Home Office concluded it could not revoke the citizenship of Alaa Abd el-Fattah , the British-Egyptian activist who was granted the status while in prison in Egypt in 2021, owing to his mother’s birth in the UK. He came to Britain on Boxing Day, despite the emergence of social media posts including one in which he talked about the need to kill “colonialists” and “Zionists”. Nonetheless, both the Conservatives and Reform UK have argued for Abd el-Fattah to be deported and to lose his UK citizenship, indicating that a future government might use the sanction more widely against dual nationals, or those from migrant backgrounds, even if they have not necessarily broken the law. The dispute ties into wider arguments about migration – an area where Keir Starmer’s government has faced accusations of trying too hard to placate voters tempted by Reform, at the cost of losing potential voters on the other side of the political divide to the Liberal Democrats and Greens. Robert Ford, a professor of political science at Manchester University, said it was possible for ministers to make a wider argument about the importance of citizenship as a right, should they want to tackle the issue head on. “If the government wanted to reverse the Shamima Begum case, they should do so on the grounds that if [British] citizenship is not a safe status for her; it’s not a safe status for anyone,” he said. “Would you like it if Nigel Farage revoked your citizenship because Israel grants your citizenship, or because you have Irish grandparents? “Citizenship is an unrestricted, unrevokable, irreversible right and status, or it is nothing, that is how you would argue for it.” However, Ford added that, while this was a plausible general argument to make, the example of Begum was unlikely to be the best way to advance it. “I say this as someone who thinks the government has erred a great deal by not adopting principled positions and [by] chasing the polling too much, but even with that in mind, the Shamima Begum case is a difficult one,” he said. “It will never be a popular thing to do because, although one can frame the issue as one of trafficking, this is somebody leaving the country to go and join IS, which is never going to be a popular cause.” Shamima Begum Human rights European court of human rights British identity and society Islamic State UK security and counter-terrorism Counter-terrorism policy analysis","Ministers cannot go on ignoring the Shamima Begum case, for two important reasons The fate of the woman who left the UK at 15 in search of Islamic State raises wider questions about citizenship While many aspects of UK political polling have shifted drastically since 2019, the public’s view on Shamima Begum has remained largely fixed: a big majority do not want the now 26-year-old woman back in the UK.

Zia was one of the most significant and divisive political figures in the country since Bangladesh independence 50 years ago. Her death was announced on Tuesday morning by the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP). Zia was the widow of former Bangladeshi president and military hero Ziaur Rahman, who had led to the fight for the country’s democracy but was killed in a military coup in 1981. She took up his political mantle with gusto and gained a loyal following for her uncompromising stance against the military dictatorship. She first came to power in 1991, remaining in office until 1996 and then served a brief second stint. However, the opposition boycotted the election result and Zia was then toppled by Hasina, who remained her arch political nemesis for the next 30 years. As Zia and Hasina alternated in the prime minister’s office over the past three decades, they stayed locked in a fierce political rivalry. Zia’s 2001 regime was mired accusations of corruption and after Hasina took power again in 2009, she was slapped with multiple cases. In 2018, Zia was found guilty and jailed on corruption charges for 10 years. Her party said the charges were politically motivated to weaken the opposition, accusations denied by the Hasina government. Under Hasina, Zia’s BNP party faced routine harassment and oppression, with most leaders jailed or forced to flee abroad. Zia remained under house arrest for years, while her health began to deteriorate. But after the fall of Hasina during in a mass uprising in 2024, she was freed from years of house arrest. In January, Zia was allowed to travel abroad for medical treatment after Hasina’s government rejected requests at least 18 times. Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026, the first vote in Bangladesh since the fall of Hasina. However, late in November, Zia was taken to hospital, where her condition continued to decline. After her death was announced, interim prime minister Muhammad Yunus released a statement, calling Zia a “symbol of the democratic movement”. Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, who had lived in exile in the UK for 18 years, returned to Bangladesh this month to contest the elections, with the BNP considered to be the frontrunners. Zia is expected to be buried on Wednesday in Dhaka, alongside her husband. Bangladesh South and central Asia news","Khaleda Zia, first female Bangladesh prime minister, dies aged 80 Zia’s archrivalry with Sheikh Hasina defined the country’s politics for a generation Khaleda Zia, the first female prime minister of Bangladesh whose long rivalry with Sheikh Hasina defined the country’s politics for a generation, has died aged 80. Zia was one of the most significant and divisive political figures in the country since Bangladesh independence 50 years ago. Her death was announced on Tuesday morning by the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP). Zia was the widow of former Bangladeshi president and military hero Ziaur Rahman, who had led to the fight for the country’s democracy but was killed in a military coup in 1981. She took up his political mantle with gusto and gained a loyal following for her uncompromising stance against the military dictatorship. She first came to power in 1991, remaining in office until 1996 and then served a brief second stint. However, the opposition boycotted the election result and Zia was then toppled by Hasina, who remained her arch political nemesis for the next 30 years. As Zia and Hasina alternated in the prime minister’s office over the past three decades, they stayed locked in a fierce political rivalry. Zia’s 2001 regime was mired accusations of corruption and after Hasina took power again in 2009, she was slapped with multiple cases. In 2018, Zia was found guilty and jailed on corruption charges for 10 years. Her party said the charges were politically motivated to weaken the opposition, accusations denied by the Hasina government. Under Hasina, Zia’s BNP party faced routine harassment and oppression, with most leaders jailed or forced to flee abroad. Zia remained under house arrest for years, while her health began to deteriorate. But after the fall of Hasina during in a mass uprising in 2024, she was freed from years of house arrest. In January, Zia was allowed to travel abroad for medical treatment after Hasina’s government rejected requests at least 18 times. Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026, the first vote in Bangladesh since the fall of Hasina. However, late in November, Zia was taken to hospital, where her condition continued to decline. After her death was announced, interim prime minister Muhammad Yunus released a statement, calling Zia a “symbol of the democratic movement”. Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, who had lived in exile in the UK for 18 years, returned to Bangladesh this month to contest the elections, with the BNP considered to be the frontrunners.

The military has touted the vote as a return to democracy almost five years after it seized power in a coup, ousting the country’s then de-facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi , detaining her and sparking a spiralling civil war. But analysts say most candidates are seen as military allies, and the UN has said the vote is being conducted in an environment of “violence and repression”, with one official describing it as a “theatre of the absurd”. The election is being carried out in three stages, with the second and third phases scheduled for January. Large areas of the country are excluded from the voting because they are under the control of anti-junta groups or in the grip of fierce fighting . The Union Solidarity and Development party (USDP), a military proxy, is fielding the largest number of candidates and expected to emerge as the largest bloc. In locations where the election is taking place, campaigning has been muted – lacking the vibrant, packed rallies that marked past votes. The red flags and signs associated with Aung San Suu Kyi, still the country’s most popular politician, and her party, the National League for Democracy, have been absent. The 80-year-old has been detained since she was ousted , and her party has been banned . The election has been condemned by western governments, but has support from China, which is the military’s most important ally. China, Russia, India and Vietnam have sent election observers, according to military-controlled media. The military has rejected criticism of the election, saying it was being conducted with public support. The head of the junta told reporters on Sunday the vote was guaranteed to be a “free and fair” election. “It’s organised by the military; we can’t let our name be tarnished,” said Min Aung Hlaing, who led the coup. “People should vote,” he added. “If they don’t vote, I will have to say they don’t completely understand what democracy really is.” Turnout in Yangon appeared lower than in previous elections. At polling stations, most residents were reluctant to be interviewed, with some saying the election was too sensitive to be discussed publicly. There was little choice on the ballot paper, said a 28-year-old man, who did not give his full name. “We already know about the election, what will happen,” he said of the vote before a relative urged him to stop speaking, warning him police were nearby. Others only shrugged or smiled when asked how they felt about the vote. A 22-year-old, who also spoke anonymously, said young men were anxious about being conscripted into the military, and were anxious not to find themselves on the radar of the authorities during the election period. He added: “Living in Myanmar is a constant worry. Whether we vote or not, the worry is there. The worry is about business, personal lives, everything is very restricted, there is no freedom … There is problem in everything in daily life.” Preliminary results of the first phase of the election will be announced on Sunday, after polling booths closed at 4pm local time, Min Aung Hlaing told reporters. In total, 57 parties are competing, though only six are doing so nationwide. “On paper, voters see a long list of party logos; in reality, meaningful opposition has been banned, jailed, or forced underground,” analysis by the Asian Network for Free Elections, an NGO, said of the vote. Tens of thousands of people have been arrested in Myanmar for expressing political views since the coup, and in July the military introduced a new election protection law that prohibits disruption or criticism of the vote. People have been arrested for putting up anti-election stickers, or for sending private Facebook messages criticising the election. Those prosecuted under the law face a sentence of at least three years in prison, or even the death penalty. In September, a man in Shan state was sentenced to seven years with hard labour under the law for criticising the election in a Facebook post. “I fear the nation is falling deeper and deeper into darkness,” said a resident in Yangon, who spoke anonymously before the election. She was not voting, and nor was her family, as they did not want to give the election credibility. Others may do so, she added, but only out of fear. “Some people are so afraid that if they don’t show up, the military will come to their homes and arrest them.” The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the elections were “clearly taking place in an environment of violence and repression”. The UN rights office said it had received reports from displaced people in several areas of the country, including Mandalay region, who had been warned they would be attacked or their homes seized if they did not return to vote. The military has presented the vote as a return to normality, and on Saturday lifted a long-standing curfew in Yangon. However, intense conflict continues to rage across large areas of the country. In Sagaing region, air and artillery strikes by junta forces continued even as polling stations opened, while attacks were also carried by anti-junta groups, according to the independent outlet Myanmar Now. Myanmar has been gripped by conflict since the coup, which abruptly ended the country’s 10-year democratic transition. The coup initially prompted huge mass protests, which the military responded to with deadly force. In response, people took up arms and joined “people’s defence forces” to fight against the junta, at times in coordination with ethnic armed groups that have long fought for greater autonomy. The conflict has plunged the country into economic turmoil, with half the population now living below the poverty line, and led to “one of the world’s most dire and yet underfunded” humanitarian crises, according to the UN . Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on human rights for Myanmar, described Sunday’s vote as a “theatre of the absurd”. He warned there was a risk it could further entrench the junta’s rule, and represent a “significant step backward for the people of Myanmar”. Campaigners have called on governments to reject the vote. Yadanar Maung, a Justice For Myanmar spokesperson, said the election was an attempt by the military to “manufacture legitimacy while it slaughters civilians with total impunity”. The military has carried out relentless airstrikes as it attempts to regain ground lost to opposition groups since the coup, and has repeatedly been accused of indiscriminately attacking civilians. It has previously denied atrocities and has said any military operations are carried out against terrorists. The second phase of the vote will take place on 11 January, with a final round on 25 January.

Here is a link to the video instead. At 14 metres tall and with intricate maze of pipes, valves and keys, the Bristol Britton organ produces ‘colossal’ sound After falling silent eight years ago, one of the UK’s largest – and loudest – concert hall instruments is bursting back into life. Standing 14 metres high and encompassing more than 5,000 pipes, Bristol’s revered Britton organ is making its comeback this weekend, revived and revitalised after a painstaking restoration. “It’s an amazing instrument,” said Jed Hughes, the organist who has the job of keeping the instrument’s manifold keys, stops and pedals moving ahead of its public return at the Bristol Beacon concert hall. “All organs have their own personalities. I’d describe this one as majestic and proud. It is confident that it can say exactly what it wants and needs to say. The volume is amazing without deafening you. They’ve brightened up the sound a bit and it fits the space perfectly.” The instrument was built in 1955 by master organ builders Harrison & Harrison after two of its predecessors were destroyed by fires in 1898 and 1945. Created for civic rather than religious purposes, it was played at what was then known as the Colston Hall for more than 60 years, becoming a centrepiece of the city’s musical heritage. When a major refurbishment of the venue began in 2018, Harrison & Harrison was asked to restore the organ, one of the few of its kind still working. Its staff carefully removed every pipe, valve and bellow, catalogued each of the many thousands of components and transported them almost 300 miles north to the company’s workshop in Durham. There, decades of grime and grit – plus nicotine staining – were scraped away and repairs made. Some of the work was heavy, some intricate – the largest pipe is 10 metres long, the smallest the size of a little finger. More than 1,000 pneumatic motors were refitted with new leather and the console, which features four keyboards, was rebuilt and mounted on a frame, making it easier to move around. The hope is that rock bands as well as classical musicians will use it in their shows. The revamped Bristol Beacon reopened in November 2023 but it has taken until now to get the organ ready, which included “voicing it” – making sure it precisely fits the venue’s main space, the Beacon Hall, which holds about 2,000 people. It is loud but can also produce subtle string and woodwind sounds. On Sunday, the celebrated organist and broadcaster Anna Lapwood will play to a sold-out crowd but in the meantime, it has been up to Hughes to keep the organ match ready. “The killer with organs is that if they sit and don’t get played, everything stops,” said Hughes, who describes himself as organ janitor. “Regular use is the best thing for an instrument.” So he has been coming in every week, kicks off his shoes, preferring to play in his socks, and performs for about three hours to an empty concert hall. “Problems may develop like a note sticking,” he said. “When that happens I notify Harrison & Harrison and it’s normally a matter of poking out a bit of dust or something and then it’s fine again.” Among the stories that have been highlighted during the restoration project was how in 1909, suffragettes hid in one of the Britton organ’s predecessors overnight to disrupt a political speech to call for votes for women. The idea now is to make the organ more accessible to Bristol citizens and in February people are being invited to join a choir , even if they have no prior experience of performing in public, and sing along on stage with the organ. A new scholarship programme is already training the next generation of young Bristol organists, trying to make sure organs remain relevant and loved. Three of them, Joshua, Christopher (both 15) and Jenna, 13, visited this week as Hughes filled the hall with music. “It sounds marvellous,” said Christopher. “It fills the hall so well.” Jenna plays the piano, drums and clarinet but loves the organ. “It’s got lots of buttons, stops. It’s fun to play.” Simon Wales, the chief executive of Bristol Beacon, described the Britton organ as a restored jewel. “Its history is woven deeply into the cultural life of Bristol.

Appearing before MPs to discuss the BBC’s efforts to counter misinformation, Davie said he had rejected calls to no longer use X. He said the BBC had to reach vulnerable young audiences around the world and said the likes of China and Iran were “flooding the zone”. “I have quite a lot of pressure to remove the BBC from X ,” he said. “By the way, that is not what I’ll be doing because we need to be on these platforms. We need to give quality information on to these social media platforms, bring people in. I actually think that’s critical, because otherwise the Chinese, the Iranians – they’re flooding the zone. They’re investing very hard. “We are in a position where the majority of 16 to 34s come to BBC every week – we’re still fighting that battle.” Davie resigned as the BBC’s director general in November last year but his successor is yet to be appointed. The former transport secretary Louise Haigh said she was leaving X and called on her party and government to do the same after the condemnation over material being produced by Grok. Haigh said the platform had become “utterly unusable” since Musk’s takeover in 2022 . She called on institutions like the BBC to follow suit. “I continued to maintain an account and occasionally post because a critical mass of people, including the government and journalists who we need to communicate with as MPs, remained on the site,” she said. “However, the revelations around the enablement, if not encouragement, of child sexual abuse mean it is unconscionable to use the site for another minute. “I would urge the government and all public bodies to remove themselves entirely from X and communicate with the public where they actually participate online and can be protected from such illegality.” Keir Starmer took aim at X on Thursday, saying he had asked Ofcom, the communications regulator, to put “all options … on the table” in dealing with it. “It’s disgraceful, it’s disgusting and it’s not to be tolerated,” he said. “X has got to get a grip of this. We will take action on this, because it’s simply not tolerable.” There are discussions taking place in Westminster among MPs and party officials over the benefits of remaining on the social media site. The Commons women and equalities committee has also decided to stop using X after the Grok AI tool began generating digitally altered images of women and children with their clothes removed. Speaking to the Commons public accounts committee, Davie said disinformation and misinformation were now “utterly rife” as Russia, China, Iran and others spend billions on media to promote their geopolitical goals. “The stakes – in my lifetime – have never been higher,” he said. The BBC is pushing for tens of millions of pounds in extra investment into the World Service this year, which executives describe as the bare minimum needed to keep services at their current level. Cuts have already been made to the World Service , with the loss of more than 100 jobs. However, Davie and other senior figures are now pushing for increased funding, given the aggressive media investment drive from the likes of China and Russia that has seen trust in their state broadcasters increase significantly in some parts of the world.

One of those with new allegations is Jason Meredith, who was three years below Farage at Dulwich college, a private school in south-east London. He claims that Farage called him a “paki” and would use taunts such as “go back home”. Meredith, 58, who is of Anglo-Indian heritage and has lived in Switzerland where he works as a product manager since 1999, said it was support for anti-racism that motivated him to come forward. He told the Guardian: “What really irked me was the denial [by Farage] of being racist.” “The word ‘paki’ was bandied by him – by Farage – there was kind of an entourage, if I remember right, hangers on,” Meredith said. “‘Go back home.’ The taunts is something I remember, the word ‘paki’, ‘go back home’ being used, certainly more than once. Simple taunts like ‘Jason is a paki’. I was 15, 16, something like that.” Meredith is one of several contemporaries to have alleged to the Guardian they were victims of targeted abuse by Farage, who has come under sustained pressure from politicians belonging to various parties to “own up” and apologise. So far, Farage has refused to do so. In a series of legal letters and subsequent interviews his position seemingly shifted from outright denial to claiming he only engaged in “banter” that was not malicious or directed with intent. On Wednesday, when questioned by an ITV News journalist about the previous allegations, Farage went further than he has in his own previous denials, saying: “I don’t apologise for things that are complete made-up fantasies. Some of what I heard was just absolute nonsense by people with very obvious, if you looked, political motivation.” Later on Wednesday, Farage told Times Radio that he acknowledged “aggressive banter”, but said claims that he had told one schoolmate to “go back to Africa” and made gas hissing noises at a Jewish pupil were “complete fantasy land”. It is a characterisation rejected by those who say they witnessed or were victims of his alleged bullying at Dulwich college. Most of the 34 have spoken to the Guardian on the record, with many saying they felt compelled to do so out of anger at the way Farage has handled the situation. Last week, Farage told the Times that the allegations were “having zero effect” and “maybe solidifying our core support.” Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, has said those who had made claims against Farage are liars and spreading “made up twaddle”. Twenty-six school contemporaries signed an open letter calling on Farage to apologise for his alleged teenage racism, which they say was persistent and spanned his time at Dulwich from 13 to 18. He has not made any public statement in response to the letter, nor to a separate letter signed by 11 Holocaust survivors demanding he tell the truth and apologise for alleged antisemitic abuse. Adrian Woods, 62, a translator, went to Dulwich for sixth form to sit his A-levels alongside Farage and Peter Ettedgui, an award-winning film director today. Ettedgui has claimed Farage would sidle up to him and say “Hitler was right” and “gas them”, sometimes adding a long hiss to simulate the sound of the gas chambers. Woods said: “I was present when Nigel was harassing [Ettedgui] about being a Jew. I don’t remember the gas chamber stuff but it was pretty obnoxious. I remember saying ‘leave off’. If I saw him bullying the smaller ones I would say: ‘Leave off, Nigel, stop it.’ “Peter always wanted to be an actor. One day he launched the Shylock monologue – ‘if you prick us, do we not bleed?’ – he felt it, as a response to Nigel needling him.” Woods added: “I remember where it was. In the new wing, on the top floor, and Nigel was standing to my left, as far as I recall, Peter nearer over the window. Peter launched into the monologue as a response to Nigel making antisemitic comments to him. This happened a few times, I witnessed this a few times. He had a lot of other people he would either rib or josh with, needle them, but some of them were more hurtful than others.” Ettedgui, who is today a Bafta- and Emmy-winning director, said drama at school had offered him a sanctuary from the abuse. “During my first year at Dulwich, the vicious antisemitic abuse Farage directed at me left me pretty much speechless,” he said. “I simply had no idea how to deal with it. But by the time we moved up into the next year, I’d discovered acting; participating in school drama was a safe haven away from Farage. “It was astonishing to learn about Adrian Woods’ memory. I had totally forgotten this moment. But it is absolutely true that I was preparing the ‘Hath a Jew not eyes?’ speech for my audition at the National Youth Theatre. “Merchant of Venice is often seen as an antisemitic play, but the words Shakespeare put in Shylock’s mouth spoke deeply to me. I’m not at all surprised that others remember me using them as a weapon with which I could refute Farage’s hate speech.” Several contemporaries have spoken of Farage having an obsession with the 1980 school roll having more boys with the surname Patel than Smith. The Guardian has verified that the 1980 roll had 13 Patels and 12 Smiths. According to one, this led to him burning a copy of the roll. Chris Kibble, 62, worked in finance. He also remembered Farage’s obsession with the surname Patel, a “diatribe that he used a lot”. He said: “I absolutely remember him kind of, you know, obviously, he discovered that one day, or his group of little mates, and it was sort of like, you know, he was, yeah, just public broadcasting about it.” Kibble also recalled Farage’s use of antisemitic language. “I was in some of those classes where, yeah, I do remember exactly that catchphrase of ‘gas em all’ coming out of [Farage’s] mouth.” Another former pupil does not remember this happening to Ettedgui in particular, but recalled one incident of Farage: “I do remember him and I do remember that specific grotesque nastiness.” He added: “The hissing – he did that to me. He would appear at one’s back and do ‘ssss’.” James Varcoe, 61, said Farage would sing songs about gassing Jews, not necessarily targeted at individuals, but with no context. Varcoe said Farage “was known for it” and described him as an “equal opportunity racist, not just antisemitic”. “All I recall is that he happily would use epithets about race, cheap epithets about race, but particularly the Jewish issue,” he said. “He used the P word, he used the N word, and happily would.” Nick Cannon, who was in the same year as Farage, said that he wrote a letter to the school’s headteacher to protest against his elevation to the position of prefect.

The supermarket, which has an almost 29% market share, according to Worldpanel by Numerator, said it had taken the most trade from Asda, the UK’s third-largest supermarket chain that has been struggling to turn around falling sales . However, shares in Tesco dropped by more than 6% on Thursday as analysts said its third-quarter sales performance was behind expectations in all markets including the UK, Ireland, central Europe and at its Booker wholesale chain. Sales in the UK rose 3.2% in the six weeks to 3 January against hopes of 3.9% while in central Europe sales rose 0.8%, about half the rate expected, and Booker’s sales fell 2.1% against hopes of an 0.8% rise. Ken Murphy, Tesco’s chief executive, said he was “not even remotely concerned about [the sales] aspect of performance” and said Booker had mostly been affected by poor trading in tobacco products which are low profit. He suggested a slight slowing of sales growth over the Christmas period compared with the prior three months was due to the company’s efforts to keep prices down. The company said it expected to deliver annual profits of about £3.1bn – the upper end of expectations. Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said many had hoped Tesco would be increasing its profit hopes and so had been disappointed. However, he said: “Tesco looks well-positioned to continue weathering macroeconomic headwinds and soft consumer sentiment. Its enormous scale and strong relationships with suppliers are a key ingredient to its success story.” Tesco said it had increased the amount of goods sold and won market share, while Murphy said it had “really leant in” on keeping prices down, keeping inflation “materially lower” than the industry level of 4.3% in December outlined by Worldpanel. Murphy said he believed Tesco could continue to take market share after it had “responded very decisively” to threats of price cutting by Asda last year. Price competition has stepped up in January as part of an annual attempt to win over shoppers recovering from a festive blowout. Asda this week pledged to drop the cost of everyday products to below those of Tesco’s and other competitors’ loyalty card prices after a tough Christmas when sales fell 4.2%, according to the latest Worldpanel figures. Under a strengthened “Asda price promise”, it said 2,300 everyday products were priced lower than loyalty card prices at Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, including fresh meat, fresh produce, chilled food and core grocery and bakery lines. Tesco this week promised to keep the cost of 3,000 branded products “consistently low” as part of its new “everyday low prices” campaign. Murphy said “consumer spending and resilience was good” in the run-up to Christmas and was “not a concern”. His comments came amid fears for the retail sector, which is facing rising costs and lacklustre consumer spending with spare cash squeezed by rising energy, food and tax bills, as well as fears about the wider global political situation and UK economy. Three retailers, the jewellery brand Claire’s, the cut-price homewares chain the Original Factory Shop and the clothing chain LK Bennett are all set to call in administrators. Marks & Spencer on Thursday revealed strong food sales growth – up 5.6% at established stores in the three months to 27 December – while clothing sales fell 2.9%. Murphy said he did not believe the government’s budget announcement in November had any “material impact on customer spend” and that households had continued to aim to have a good time although they were “seeking great value without a shadow of a doubt”. “Consumer sentiment is mixed. Some households’ budgets are in really good shape and others are counting every penny,” he said. He said the outlook for 2026 was reasonably positive: “Employment is still resilient and that is a key fact in how consumers feel about the world. What we have seen over Christmas, despite comments to the contrary, is that people spent and bought into celebrating with their family.” He said Tesco was not concerned about new worker protections in the Employment Rights Act , which are due to come into force later this year, as it had already adopted many of the measures. However, Murphy called on the government to revamp the business rates system, which he said was unfair. While Tesco will not pay more under the new regime announced in November, Murphy said retailers and hospitality businesses paid more than their fair share.

He suggested a slight slowing of sales growth over the Christmas period compared with the prior three months was due to the company’s efforts to keep prices down. The company said it expected to deliver annual profits of about £3.1bn – the upper end of expectations. Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said many had hoped Tesco would be increasing its profit hopes and so had been disappointed. However, he said: “Tesco looks well-positioned to continue weathering macroeconomic headwinds and soft consumer sentiment. Its enormous scale and strong relationships with suppliers are a key ingredient to its success story.” Tesco said it had increased the amount of goods sold and won market share, while Murphy said it had “really leant in” on keeping prices down, keeping inflation “materially lower” than the industry level of 4.3% in December outlined by Worldpanel. Murphy said he believed Tesco could continue to take market share after it had “responded very decisively” to threats of price cutting by Asda last year. Price competition has stepped up in January as part of an annual attempt to win over shoppers recovering from a festive blowout. Asda this week pledged to drop the cost of everyday products to below those of Tesco’s and other competitors’ loyalty card prices after a tough Christmas when sales fell 4.2%, according to the latest Worldpanel figures. Under a strengthened “Asda price promise”, it said 2,300 everyday products were priced lower than loyalty card prices at Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, including fresh meat, fresh produce, chilled food and core grocery and bakery lines. Tesco this week promised to keep the cost of 3,000 branded products “consistently low” as part of its new “everyday low prices” campaign. Murphy said “consumer spending and resilience was good” in the run-up to Christmas and was “not a concern”. His comments came amid fears for the retail sector, which is facing rising costs and lacklustre consumer spending with spare cash squeezed by rising energy, food and tax bills, as well as fears about the wider global political situation and UK economy. Three retailers, the jewellery brand Claire’s, the cut-price homewares chain the Original Factory Shop and the clothing chain LK Bennett are all set to call in administrators. Marks & Spencer on Thursday revealed strong food sales growth – up 5.6% at established stores in the three months to 27 December – while clothing sales fell 2.9%. Murphy said he did not believe the government’s budget announcement in November had any “material impact on customer spend” and that households had continued to aim to have a good time although they were “seeking great value without a shadow of a doubt”. “Consumer sentiment is mixed. Some households’ budgets are in really good shape and others are counting every penny,” he said. He said the outlook for 2026 was reasonably positive: “Employment is still resilient and that is a key fact in how consumers feel about the world. What we have seen over Christmas, despite comments to the contrary, is that people spent and bought into celebrating with their family.” He said Tesco was not concerned about new worker protections in the Employment Rights Act , which are due to come into force later this year, as it had already adopted many of the measures. However, Murphy called on the government to revamp the business rates system, which he said was unfair. While Tesco will not pay more under the new regime announced in November, Murphy said retailers and hospitality businesses paid more than their fair share.

A demonstration attended by thousands on Wednesday night went peacefully after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Macklin Good, 37, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) officer hours earlier. Scores of people bundled up in heavy coats gathered in a parking lot near a building that houses several federal agencies, including an immigration court. The crowd was chanting and holding American flags and signs calling on ICE to leave Minnesota . Police at one point threw devices releasing smoke to break up the crowd, which carried signs and shouted profanities at them. One of the protestors, Patrick Riley, told the Associated Press: “We are peacefully demonstrating. We’re trying to let this organization know that they’re not welcome.” But emotions remained high in the city – and across the US – as the Trump administration continued to portray the victim, who was shot multiple times as she drove away from a group of officers, as a “domestic terrorist” bent on running them over. “Trump wants a show. Don’t give it to him,” Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic governor, posted on X Wednesday night, urging protesters to remain calm. He said he had issued a “warning order” for possible deployment of the Minnesota national guard. Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar posted on social media Thursday morning that thousands had gathered to honor the victim last night, and that “ICE needs to get out of Minneapolis”. “We will never accept that a single federal agent can be judge, jury and executioner in our streets,” she said. Jacob Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, made several appearances on television networks Wednesday night calling for peaceful protests and doubling down on his comments at a press conference earlier in the day in which he called for ICE “to get the fuck out of Minneapolis”. “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now, somebody is dead,” Frey said. He said the homeland security department was already “trying to spin this as an action of self-defense”, a claim he said was “bullshit”. Some Republicans seized on Frey’s comments as incendiary, with Nancy Mace, a South Carolina congresswoman, calling for the resignation of the mayor and Walz. Yet much of the political rhetoric continued to come from the White House, with Donald Trump telling reporters from the New York Times on Wednesday night that Macklin Good, a mother of a six-year-old son, was at fault. “She behaved horribly,” said Trump, who posted to Truth Social earlier in the day without evidence that “viciously ran over the ICE Officer”. “And then she ran him over. She didn’t try to run him over. She ran him over,” the president said. Video of the confrontation , however, showed the agent remaining on his feet and walking away apparently uninjured after the woman’s car had crashed into a lamp-post and a parked vehicle. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said the woman had been “stalking” the ICE agents and blocking traffic, another claim not supported by the video, which showed her initially reversing and allowing at least one ICE vehicle to pass. Noem also stated that ICE operations would continue in Minneapolis, which saw a surge of about 2,000 federal agents this week to target immigrant populations. Residents in the city, which has a large Somali population, described the mood as “ on edge and angry ” on Thursday, with more demonstrations planned for later in the day. Anti-ICE protests took place in a number of US cities on Wednesday after news of the incident spread, and more are scheduled for Thursday, including in New York, Houston and San Diego.

The 52-year-old Democrat, who has governed the crucial swing state since January 2023, made the announcement Thursday with planned events in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. “We’ve gotten a whole lot done on issues that have been stuck for decades. But there’s always more to do – more people to help, more Pennsylvanians to protect, more bridges to build,” Shapiro said in a campaign video . “We’re moving our Commonwealth forward.” The re-election campaign comes at a pivotal moment for Shapiro, whose name has been floated alongside California’s Gavin Newsom, Illinois’s JB Pritzker, Maryland’s Wes Moore and Pete Buttigieg as potential Democratic presidential candidates come 2028. His near-landslide victory in 2022 established him as a rising star capable of winning in a battleground state that Donald Trump carried in 2024. But unlike some potential rivals who are either term-limited or out of public office, Shapiro must first navigate a competitive race in a midterm year filled with Democratic vitriol towards Trump, offering an early measure of his viability as a national candidate. As governor, he earned a reputation as a pragmatic moderate who can work across party lines, having secured increased funding for public schools and protecting abortion access. Yet his centrism has drawn criticism from progressives who argue he prioritizes caution over transformative change, particularly on climate policy and education reform. His vocal support for Israel during the war and total destruction of Gaza also sparked opposition from some Democratic activists who campaigned against his potential vice-presidential nomination. Shapiro, who in his youth volunteered with the Israeli army, emerged as one of the Democratic party’s most prominent pro-Israel voices over the last few years, and had also described what he saw as antisemitism within pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Last April, an arsonist attempted to burn down the governor’s mansion with Shapiro and his family inside following their Passover dinner. In her recent memoir, the former vice-president Kamala Harris wrote that she declined to select Shapiro as her running mate after he told her he expected to be involved in every decision she made. Shapiro has called her account “complete and utter bullshit” and accused her of spreading “blatant lies” to sell books. Shapiro has also proved willing to confront Trump directly, filing numerous lawsuits against the administration over withheld state funding and condemning the president’s tariff policies as “reckless” and “dangerous”. He recently called into a Pittsburgh morning radio show to say the nabbing of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro was “crazy” and part of a “bully’s weakness”. “It sounds like a massive nation-building project with basically no plan for what comes next, other than [Trump] stealing Venezuela’s oil to enrich his friends,” Shapiro said.

Fema has already seen a mass exodus of staff since Trump re-entered the White House in January. Further cuts would be “an affront to not only the law, but also to common sense when we are in a situation where states and local communities have been vocal about the fact they do not have the ability or the capacity to replicate what Fema does for them”, one longtime Fema official, who requested anonymity, told the Guardian. The response came after dozens of senior agency employees on 23 December reportedly received notice about the launch of a workforce planning exercise, asking them to identify which Fema positions are critically necessary for the agency’s operations and which could be slashed. It also included a spreadsheet outlining a goal to cut Fema staff by more than 50% by the next fiscal year’s start in October, though it reportedly no said decisions about workforce reductions have not been finalized. Reached for comment, a Fema spokesperson said the agency “has not issued and is not implementing a percentage-based workforce reduction. “There is no directive to reduce the agency’s workforce by 50 percent, and no such target has been approved by DHS or the White House. The materials referenced from the leaked documentation stem from a routine, pre-decisional workforce planning exercise,” the spokesperson said. “An accompanying spreadsheet was an internal working tool used to collect planning inputs. Any numerical assumptions reflected in that draft were not approved, were not adopted, and do not represent FEMA policy or leadership direction.” But the 50% target echoes recommendations from the the task force which Donald Trump set up last year to help overhaul the agency. A draft of that group’s final report, which was leaked to CNN last month also called for cutting the agency’s workforce in half and shifting many full-time staff out of Washington, DC, to nationwide regional offices. “Political leadership at Fema can pretend that this is just a training exercise, but anyone with eyes knows that Kristi Noem has been hellbent on such workforce reductions and they have already successfully fired or laid off literally thousands of full time staff,” said Edwards, the former spokesperson for Fema. “It seems like an oddly specific exercise to do if it’s not something you are actively preparing for.” Edwards said he participated in training exercises while at Fema, “but never something like this”. “They are usually situation-based and related to specific emergency events, in my experience,” he said. “So, it’s very strange to just randomly say: ‘What if we cut the staff by 50%?’ It’s less strange when you remember that this type of staff reduction is something this administration has had its eye on.” Nearly 2,450 employees of Fema are estimated to have exited the agency since the second Trump administration began. On 31 December 2025, some employees also reportedly received emails saying their positions would not be renewed once their contracts expire in the first days of January. Those recent cuts specifically target the agency’s Cadre of On-Call Response and Recovery (Core) teams, its term-limited workforce that provides crucial support in disaster response and recovery efforts. These recent changes could be a major blow to disaster recovery, the longtime Fema official said. “Imagine if we had to tackle a Helene or Milton or Maria or Irma without the backbone of our forward deploying force,” the person said. “These decisions are made by people at the top of fema and at DHS who have no idea how anything works, don’t care about the agency or its people, or the American people. Their only goal is to prove who can show the most fealty to the administration no matter how damaging or cruel those actions end up being.” Edwards said changes under Noem are pushing the agency in the wrong direction. “The agency should be focused on preparing communities for inevitable disasters, not its own demise.” US news US politics Kristi Noem Trump administration news","Fema staff outraged by draft plans for deep cuts under Trump Staff warn the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem’s, proposed cuts could weaken Fema’s disaster response Current and former staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) expressed outraged over reports that the agency has drafted plans to eliminate thousands of staff in 2026 – part of a broader restructuring effort being overseen by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem . “The Trump administration seems determined to continue weakening the agency’s efforts to help people before, during and after disasters,” Jeremy Edwards, former spokesperson for Fema and the White House under Joe Biden’s presidency, told the Guardian.

These recent changes could be a major blow to disaster recovery, the longtime Fema official said. “Imagine if we had to tackle a Helene or Milton or Maria or Irma without the backbone of our forward deploying force,” the person said. “These decisions are made by people at the top of fema and at DHS who have no idea how anything works, don’t care about the agency or its people, or the American people. Their only goal is to prove who can show the most fealty to the administration no matter how damaging or cruel those actions end up being.” Edwards said changes under Noem are pushing the agency in the wrong direction. “The agency should be focused on preparing communities for inevitable disasters, not its own demise.” US news US politics Kristi Noem Trump administration news",Security,United States,NEGATIVE,0.9994681477546692

It became clear Saturday with the seizure of Venezuela's leader, <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2026/01/03/maduro-capture-reasons-us-venezuela"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Maduro</a>, for alleged drug trafficking.</li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news:</strong> President Trump <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/%40realDonaldTrump/115850817778602689"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> Tuesday on Truth Social that the U.S. would receive as many as 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil from Venezuela, worth about $2.5 billion. Venezuela would share in the profits from the sale, Trump said.</p><ul><li>On Friday, Trump plans to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2026/01/07/trump-oil-executives-venezuela"" target=""_blank"">meet</a> with a dozen oil executives in the White House to discuss boosting Venezuelan oil production.</li><li>Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pressuring Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, to kick suspected intelligence officials from China, Cuba, Iran and Russia out of Venezuela.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> Trump's Tuesday announcement came at a crucial time for Venezuela's petrol-funded government. It's teetering on economic collapse, partly because of a U.S. blockade of most oil tankers leaving the country, sent there to pressure Maduro to leave office.</p><ul><li>In Sunday show interviews and private conversations with Congress, Rubio talked openly about how Venezuela's economic woes were ""leverage"" for the U.S. to force the socialist regime to open its markets.</li><li>""We need to get the oil flowing out and the money going back to Venezuela without it getting stolen,"" a senior administration official told Axios. ""It's no easy task.""</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> An anti-communist Cuban-American lawmaker from Miami, Rubio has been an outspoken proponent of bringing democracy to socialist regimes such as those in Venezuela and Cuba. </p><ul><li>But in Trump's government, realpolitik, brute force and national interests are supreme.</li><li>That doesn't necessarily mean the administration won't eventually call for elections in Venezuela.</li><li>""There will be elections at the right time, but [Trump's] top priority is to bring Venezuela back from the dead and rebuild the country,"" another White House official told Axios.</li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue</strong>: The toppling of Maduro was a surgical strike that left the rest of his socialist regime in place in Caracas, an effort to keep it stable.

He gave about 15 million barrels a year to Cuba for free and has sold discounted oil to Russia and China.</li><li>Venezuela has about 30 million barrels of oil stored on land and about 16 million more barrels on tankers in its waters, according Tankertrackers.com, a firm that monitors shipping.</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying: </strong>Trump administration advisers say the president has a chance to reframe the U.S. relationship with Venezuela's people by making it clear they'll benefit with Maduro gone.</p><ul><li>Trump — who's responded, ""Me,"" when he was asked who controls Venezuela's oil, ""needs to stop sounding like he's just taking their oil,"" one adviser said. </li><li>""The [Maduro] regime was stealing oil and sending it for free to Cuba.

axios,The 5 economic themes we're watching in 2026,"<p>Tariff drama and tax cuts! AI spending and AI-spurred job losses! New Federal Reserve leadership! It is on track to be a big year across all the key policy areas of interest to economy-watchers.</p><p><strong>The big picture:</strong> Seismic changes have been set in motion by the Trump administration's sweeping policy agenda and a mega-wave of investment in artificial intelligence — likely to determine the fate of the economy in 2026.</p><h2>1. The AI economy</h2><p><strong>The biggest macro questions</strong> are whether the alarm bells about AI and the labor market will start to ring true — and whether the productivity effects move from just anecdotes to the economic data.</p><ul><li>Last year, much evidence pointed to AI as a marginal part of the labor market slowdown. Some economists (and officials inside the White House) argue that broader adoption of the technology would boost the labor market, at least in the short term. </li></ul><p><strong>Of note: </strong>AI spending buoyed economic growth, at least in the first nine months of 2025. It is also lifting the stock market, which might help support spending among wealthier consumers.</p><ul><li>Whether this turns out to be a bubble that pops — and the extent such a risk poses to the broader financial system as the Fed rolls back regulations — is the related theme to watch.</li><li>That said, any correction in AI investment looks more likely to be a down-the-road story than a 2026 issue.</li></ul><h2>2. Tax cut boost</h2><p><strong>The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act</strong>, signed into law in July, is set to have its maximum economic punch in the early months of 2026, a likely tailwind for overall economic growth.</p><ul><li>But how large, how broad-based and how sustained that boost will turn out to be remains to be seen.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in: </strong>Fiscal policy is on track to add about 2.3 percentage points to first-quarter GDP growth, per data from the Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure<strong> </strong>from the Brookings Institution.</p><ul><li>On the individual tax side, beneficiaries of policies like a deduction for tip income, Social Security payments and expanded deductibility of state and local tax are on track to generate super-sized tax refunds this spring, </li><li>On the corporate side, businesses are enjoying new tax incentives for capital spending, especially on factories.</li><li>Federal spending on immigration enforcement, meanwhile, is ramping up due to the legislation.</li></ul><h2>3. Trade uncertainty (maybe) resolving</h2><p><strong>Any day now, </strong>the Supreme Court will hand down a decision that might scramble the centerpiece of President Trump's economic agenda: the ability to impose huge tariffs unilaterally.</p><ul><li>If the court strikes down the bulk of Trump's tariffs, fiscal revenues could be put at risk, resulting in a chaotic refund process.</li><li>That said, the ruling will help create some guardrails on what kinds of legal authority the president has to impose unilateral tariffs. That, in turn, could lead to a more stable tariff picture (albeit with much higher rates than pre-2025).</li><li>While there are other authorities the president can use to enact tariffs besides the sweeping authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act he has claimed, they require a more deliberative process than the kind of whipsawing that importers faced last year.</li></ul><h2>4. Future of the Fed</h2><p><strong>Fed chair Jerome Powell's term</strong> is up in May, and Trump's selection of his successor is imminent, with Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh the leading <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2025/10/27/trump-fed-reserve-chair-powell-hassett"" target=""_blank"">job candidates</a>.</p><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>Whoever takes the reins will face immense pressure from Trump to lower interest rates to rock-bottom levels — amid continued high inflation — and how they handle that pressure may determine the future of the central bank's independence from the White House.</p><ul><li>Trump expects the future Fed chair to consult with him on <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2025/12/30/fed-inflation-interest-rates-economy"" target=""_blank"">rates</a>, while casting the intention to lower rates as a key qualification for the next leader.</li><li>The question is whether the next Fed chair can resist that political pressure and whether financial markets believe that is the case. If bond markets lose confidence that the Fed will raise short-term rates if necessary to combat an inflation surge, it could paradoxically drive up long-term rates.</li><li>Another huge question: the makeup of the influential Fed board, with the Supreme Court also set to decide whether Trump can fire governor Lisa Cook and, by extension, other Biden-appointed governors.</li></ul><h2>5. Affordability and the midterms</h2><p><strong>With voters going to the polls</strong> in November, the cost of living is emerging as a core battleground.</p><ul><li>Democrats seeking to take control of Congress are making political hay about the affordability crisis.</li><li>Trump has called the term affordability a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/02/us/politics/trump-affordability-economy-messaging.html"" target=""_blank"">""con job,""</a> but said recently that he believes ""pricing"" will be a major election issue.</li></ul><p><strong>Flashback: </strong>The Consumer Price Index is up a moderate 2.7% over the last 12 months, but that increase came on top of the Biden-era inflation surge.</p><ul><li>The index is up 23.7% since January 2021, even more for some often-purchased subcategories, including groceries (up 24.6%).</li></ul><p><strong>Over the holiday break,</strong> the administration quietly shelved plans to impose levies on imported <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2026/01/02/trump-pasta-tariff-italy-imports"" target=""_blank"">pasta</a> and furniture.</p><ul><li>It's a hint that the White House is eager to avoid trade levies that might flow directly to prices consumers pay, as opposed to affecting input costs for businesses.</li></ul>",https://www.axios.com/2026/01/05/economy-tariffs-ai,"Mon, 05 Jan 2026 17:01:59 +0000",2026-01-05 17:01:59+00:00,,The 5 economic themes we're watching in 2026 ,Economy,,NEUTRAL,0.0

But we're actually experiencing the aftershocks of a decade of disruption in America and other advanced economies.</p><p><strong>The era of<em> post-disruption society</em></strong><em></em> has begun.

People distrust everyone with power or legacy.</li><li>The surge of AI as an unrivaled, but polarizing, economic and political force.</li><li>A big spike in public pessimism about government, economics, politics and life.</li><li>A fast shift in what leaders need to know, do and master to survive.</li></ul><p><strong>What's most striking </strong>is how these trends seem to be hitting every nation in very similar ways. A great example: The top political issue in <em>every </em>nation surveyed by FGS was inflation/cost of living.</p><ul><li>Health care was second in all but Japan (housing) and Canada (taxes).</li><li>Just as inequality, migration and institutional decay foretold the explosion of populism across America and Europe, the reverberations are landing similarly across the nations surveyed.</li></ul><p><strong>Let's go deeper </strong>on each big shift:</p><p><strong>1. Reality collapses:</strong> America isn't alone in witnessing a massive shattering of its common reality. The same mess is metastasizing across Europe, Canada and Japan.</p><ul><li>61% say mainstream news media can't be trusted. Politicians are the least trusted source of truth (22%), worse than ChatGPT (34%). More and more people worldwide cling to influencers in an atomized media ecosystem for some version of reality, leaving those people highly susceptible to manipulation and misinformation.</li></ul><p><strong>2. AI scares: </strong>FGS found the same thing Axios is seeing in our internal readership data — a huge gap in AI views between people in power (elites) and everyone else. Elites are more optimistic of AI and more skeptical of regulation. Non-elites in all nations favor AI regulations. Young people, in particular, fear imminent job threats in every nation surveyed.</p><ul><li>Fun/scary fact: 35% think AI will ""control"" humans.</li><li>Generational tensions are rising: Older people feel displaced. Young people feel locked out.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Pessimism soars: </strong>We have a global gloom crisis on our hands. Huge majorities across all nations believe things are getting harder (73%) and are hopelessly rigged for the rich (74%), while their national identity (62%) and democracies (69%) slip away. ""Pessimism on this scale, replicated across democracies, is not normal and may not be sustainable,"" FGS concludes.</p><ul><li>🚨 There is a strong, striking, similar desire (75%+) to preserve and protect traditional culture.</li><li><strong>Sad fact: </strong>A majority of Gen Z and millennials think it's impossible for some people to ever succeed, regardless of hard work.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Leadership shifts: </strong>Anyone leading anything needs to rethink their assumptions and approach. You're operating in a hyper-volatile environment where people are anxious; distrustful of almost everyone in — and everything about — power; downbeat about the present and future; and fearful of AI making everything worse. Leaders urgently need new systems to understand the various realities, level with those around them about AI and its effect on their specific jobs, and prepare for hyper-volatility to accelerate.</p><ul><li>FGS points out that CEO access to senior White House officials is unusually direct, with the C-suite increasingly involved in government affairs on top issues.</li><li>The skills that workers and employers need are changing much faster than reskilling is kicking in. ""The pace of change may be as disruptive as the direction of change,"" FGS concludes.</li></ul><p><strong>What <em>you</em> can do: </strong>This moment might feel impossible to navigate. It's not. It starts with broadening your thinking to match the new reality.</p><ul><li>If you're a leader or doing well, remember the vast majority of your fellow citizens, especially young ones, don't share your enthusiasm for booming markets and super-human AI. Everyone needs to do a better job explaining AI and other fast changes.</li><li>Most people don't read, watch or listen to what you do. This requires a <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/10/28/election-news-media-trump-harris"" target=""_blank"">deeper understanding</a> of our <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/03/25/news-media-filter-bubble-different-realities"" target=""_blank"">atomized media reality</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>People are hungry</strong> for clear, blunt, useful perspectives and directions at work, places of worship, and near home. The FGS study captured the hunger for authentic connection.</p><ul><li>Pessimism isn't a permanent condition.

Trump also wants Venezuela's oil and blames Maduro for causing an unprecedented migration crisis.</p><ul><li>Rubio ""knows the region, knows the politics. He speaks Spanish basically as a first language,"" a senior White House adviser said. ""There's a reason the president chose him as secretary and as his national security adviser.""</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> Rubio flexed those bilingual skills Saturday, first by informing Congress of the U.S. military incursion, then by speaking in Spanish via phone with Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez.</p><ul><li>Rubio and Rodríguez could have daily calls, the adviser told Axios, as Trump decides what to do next with Venezuela.</li><li>""It's going to be done by a small committee, led by Rubio, with the president heavily engaged,"" the official said.</li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue</strong>: Hours after Trump described the Rubio-Rodríguez call as friendly and productive, Rodríguez publicly spoke out, denouncing the snatching of Maduro and calling him the rightful president.</p><ul><li>U.S. officials and experts brushed off her statements as domestic political pandering to hold together the various factions of Venezuela's Chavistas, the nickname given to the left-wingers who gained power under Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez.</li><li>Those factions include Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister accused by the first Trump administration of <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/13/rubio-venezuela-plot-241591/"" target=""_blank"">plotting to</a> assassinate Rubio in 2017, when he was a U.S. senator and had emerged as first-term President Trump's top adviser on the Western Hemisphere.</li><li>Cabello was charged in a second <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1422326/dl"" target=""_blank"">superseding indictment</a> of Maduro that was released Saturday. Rubio allies say the secretary of state wouldn't mind seeing Cabello snatched as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> The fact that just Maduro was taken while Cabello, Rodríguez and her brother, National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez, have so far been untouched by U.S. forces is a sign Trump and Rubio want to keep Venezuela's government intact — for now.</p><ul><li>It's a break from the Bush administration's disastrous decision to purge leaders of Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq after the invasion, which led to an insurgency.</li><li>""This isn't de-Baathification,"" a Rubio ally told Axios. ""This is intentional and methodical.""</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom out:</strong> Trump and Rubio view Venezuela as one of the last major lifelines to communist Cuba, which has supplied intelligence services to Venezuela's regime in return for free oil.</p><ul><li>""One of the biggest problems the Venezuelans have is they have to declare their independence from Cuba, which tried to basically colonize it from a security standpoint,"" Rubio said Saturday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago news conference. ""If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned.""</li><li>Rubio has attacked Cuba's government as an axis of evil in the hemisphere since before he won his first office, as West Miami's city commissioner. His focus on Cuba has continued through his time as a Florida state representative and state House speaker, into his time in the U.S. Senate, and now in Trump's administration.</li></ul><p><strong>The backstory</strong>: Trump's push for regime change in Venezuela isn't a new idea for him. He began paying close attention to the issue a month after assuming office in his first term in 2017, when Rubio brought the wife of a jailed political prisoner, Leopoldo López, to meet the new president in the White House.</p><ul><li>In 2019, partly at Rubio's urging, Trump became the first world leader to recognize Maduro's then-opponent, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela's legitimate leader.</li><li>At the time, Trump considered military strikes on Venezuela. But Rubio talked him out of it, partly by pointing out that the U.S. didn't have enough military assets in the region to launch effective strikes against the South American nation.</li></ul><p><strong>That all changed this year,</strong> when Trump chose Rubio as his secretary of state and tasked him with pressuring Maduro to leave office.</p><ul><li>Rubio, recognized as the administration's foremost expert on Latin America, was part of a small working group that included Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Dan Caine, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.</li><li>All of them flanked Trump at Saturday's press conference about the strikes in Venezuela. The president said they'd be involved in planning what comes next in the post-Maduro era.</li><li>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will join the post-Maduro working group, officials said.</li></ul><p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Trump administration officials quietly acknowledge they could be in for ""some bumps in the road,"" as one adviser said.</p><ul><li>But they believe this regime-change operation will be successful like the 1989 invasion of Panama and the ouster of Panama's Manuel Noriega. </li></ul><p><strong>What's next: </strong>Venezuela is facing a financial crisis amid Trump's sanctions on its oil and his decision to seize and interdict tankers. When and how they're lifted is crucial.</p><ul><li>Venezuela also has a violent gang problem that could prove troublesome for U.S. peacekeepers if they're deployed.</li><li>And tough decisions remain about when to call for free and fair elections. Maduro is widely viewed as having <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/08/02/us-venezuela-elections-maduro-gonzalez"" target=""_blank"">stolen</a> his <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-presidential-election-maduro-machado-edmundo-5ce255ae90614162590bfe1207d2e1d0"" target=""_blank"">election in 2024</a>.</li><li>Trump's decision Saturday to speak dismissively of Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, last year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, struck many supporters of the president as tone deaf and ill-placed.</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying: </strong>Trump and Rubio's foes had little to criticize about the efficiency of Saturday's regime change operation, but called it a violation of international law that leaves the U.S. with tripwires ahead.</p><ul><li>""This could come home to haunt them in the midterms and really blow up in their face,"" said Juan Gonzalez, who negotiated with Maduro's regime during the Biden administration.</li><li>""For Trump, right now, he's looking great,"" Gonzalez said.

A recent issue of the group's weekly newsletter Al-Naba, translated by Newsweek , said, ""A security source told Al-Naba that Nigerian Nusari [a derogative word the group uses for Christians] are a legitimate target for the mujahideen and that they have the opportunity to spare their blood by converting to Islam or paying the jizya to the Muslim Imam in the West Africa Province."" U.S. Representative Riley Moore, a Republican from West Virginia who has long been outspoken about attacks on Christians in Nigeria, wrote on X in response to news of the group's statement: ""If there were any remaining doubts that Christians in Nigeria are being targeted for their faith in Jesus Christ, this should end that debate."" The Nigerian government has repeated its long-standing denials that Christians are being targeted for their religion, telling Newsweek , ""Terrorists in Nigeria target anyone who stands in their way, Christian or Muslim."" Why It Matters U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has framed the violence in Nigeria as Christian persecution. This came to a head over Christmas , when Trump announced that the U.S. Department of Defense had ""launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians."" The Nigerian government said this was a joint mission but reiterated its position that terrorist violence in the country was indiscriminate. Statements like the one quoted in Al-Naba add to the debate about the context in which the violence in Nigeria is taking place. What To Know Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) made its statement about Christians' ""opportunity to spare their blood by converting to Islam"" alongside an image of the burning village Timwai, in Adamawa state in northeastern Nigeria, on December 26, according to Newsweek 's translation of the Al-Naba newsletter. This attack was recorded by the Middle East Media Research Institute, which reported that ISWAP had claimed responsibility for it. Four Christians are believed to have been shot dead in the attack, but this has not been confirmed. Newsweek has contacted Adamawa's local government for comment via email. Moore, commenting on a post about the group's statement shared by West and East Africa analyst Brant Philip, wrote on X: ""This isn't about land usage, 'climate change,' or any other argument the Left wants to make. This is persecution of our brothers and sisters for their faith in Christ, plain and simple. ""ISIS is telling Christians they have an opportunity to 'spare their blood' if they convert. Our brothers and sisters will not bend the knee to anyone but our Lord and Savior though. “Thankfully, [President Donald Trump] is continuing to work in cooperation with the Nigerian government to stop these Islamic radicals and defend our brothers and sisters in Christ."" Alkasim Abdulkadir, the special assistant on media and communications strategy to Nigeria's minister of foreign affairs, pushed back against this characterization. ""It is inaccurate to claim or insist that ISWAP/Boko Haram targets Christians only,"" he told Newsweek . ""The evidence suggests otherwise, it shows they attack both Christian and Muslim communities alike."" ""Their objective is to intimidate the entire population and undermine Nigeria's constitutional order,"" he added. There were a spate of attacks in Nigeria in the days after Christmas and over the New Year's Eve period, according to the international Christian advocacy group Open Doors, which said at least 70 people—Christians and Muslims—were killed by different militant groups, including Fulani militants. At least 14 people were killed on December 29, when Islamic militants struck several villages in the predominantly Christian Adamawa state, according to multiple media reports, including from national outlet Punch, Open Doors and International Christian Concern. The chairman of Hong Local Government Area in Adamawa State, Usman Inuwa, told Punch that the groups responsible for this killing was Boko Haram. Religious Persecution in Nigeria There are conflicting statistics about how many Christians have been killed in Nigeria, and how many of those died as a result of their faith. Open Doors lists Nigeria as the seventh most dangerous place for Christians on its World Watch list, adding, ""more Christians are killed for their faith in Nigeria than in the rest of the world combined."" Newsweek previously reported what Christian nongovernmental organizations have said about the situation there. Nigeria's population is about evenly split between Christians and Muslims. It has faced decades of violence with roots not only in religious but also ethnic division, criminality, local politics, poverty and battles over land between farmers and herders that have been exacerbated by shifts in the climate. The country has been struggling with a surge in jihadist violence since 2009, which marked the start of Boko Haram's insurgency to establish a caliphate in Nigeria and the broader Sahel region. The groups that carry out this violence include Fulani militants, Boko Haram and ISWAP, according to Open Doors and several other NGOs. What People Are Saying Alkasim Abdulkadir, the special assistant on media and communications strategy to Nigeria's minister of foreign affairs, told Newsweek : ""Terrorists in Nigeria target anyone who stands in their way, Christian or Muslim. We need to understand that ISWAP is a terrorist organization that targets the Nigerian state and all civilians, regardless of faith."" Jabez Musa, a Christian human rights lawyer who uses a pseudonym for security reasons, previously told Newsweek : ""Gradually, Christians are being wiped out and churches have been destroyed."" What Happens Next Nigeria and the United States have pledged ongoing counterterrorism cooperation. The Nigerian government has emphasized its commitment to defending citizens regardless of their faith and stressed a multifaceted approach to tackling insecurity.

newsweek,Venezuelans Tell ‘Privileged’ Americans: Stop Explaining Our Struggle,"As social-media timelines flood with Venezuela explainer content, Venezuelans ask outsiders to stop explaining their struggle.",https://www.newsweek.com/venezuelans-tell-privileged-americans-stop-explaining-our-struggle-11321475,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:23:11 -0500",2026-01-08 11:23:11-05:00,"Life & Trends Reporter Since news of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro’s extradition on January 3, the geopolitical drama has sparked a social-media theatrical storm. As global spectators scramble to understand what is unfolding, commentators have rushed to share hot takes and 'simple' explainers. However, many Venezuelans have criticized this rapid algorithmic response—and attempt to ""Venezuelasplain"" their history—as condescending and belittling. What Has Happened in Venezuela? On January 3, the U.S. launched a shock, large-scale strike against Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Maduro was arrested and extradited to New York, where he remains imprisoned. He pleaded not guilty to drug charges and declared he had been ""kidnapped."" The Venezuelan vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, has been named interim president. President Trump announced that the U.S. is ""going to run the country, until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,"" but many have condemned the military action, with many legal experts and politicians around the world deeming it unlawful. Anna Kelly, the White House's deputy press secretary, told Newsweek : ""The successful rendition of Nicolas Maduro to the United States to answer for his lifetime of crimes was lawful. As in prior administrations, the entire Trump Administration coordinated to arrest the head of a major narcotrafficking Foreign Terrorist Organization, who has long been a fugitive of American justice. Once again, President Trump‘s decisive leadership will result in peace in the world."" In 1998, Hugo Chávez was elected and moved to bring Venezuela’s oil industry under state control. After his death in 2013, Nicolás Maduro succeeded him. Maduro’s 2018 reelection was widely disputed, as was his 2024 victory. Protests followed, with thousands arrested, including human rights defenders and journalists. Amnesty International said that, between July 28 and August 1, following the presidential election, at least 24 people died during anti-government protests. Two of the casualties were children, and one a police officer. By the end of that year, more than 7.89 million Venezuelans had fled the country. Many have taken to TikTok, asking Americans and Westerners to stop telling them how to feel about Maduro's ousting—which many are happy about, despite the ethical and legal complexities. The Confluence of a Complicated History ""We live in an era where content is incentivized by clicks and likes on the topic du jour, which pulls influencers into spheres where they may have no knowledge or expertise. Social media rewards simplistic hot takes, not complex content,"" Dr. Christine J. Wade, a specialist in the international and comparative politics of Latin America at Washington College, told Newsweek . Wade said that there is not a single Venezuelan story, but rather ""the confluence of a complicated history."" ""How are influencers who couldn’t find Venezuela on a map a week ago supposed to navigate this?"" Wade asked. Speaking with Newsweek , Venezuelans shared their frustrations over having their history explained to them. 'Disagreeing Is Fine. Erasing Our Intelligence and Our Pain Is Not' Anna Caldera ( @pelonacibernetica) , 26, grew up in a small town called Guatire and then moved to Catia in the capital of Caracas. In November 2023, she moved to Barcelona, Spain. She has created multiple videos on the subject; her most-viral take garnered over 1.8 million views and called out ""privileged"" people for attempting to explain the Venezuelan struggle to her. Caldera told Newsweek : ""The closest way I can explain how it feels is like being mansplained about your own body—except this is my country. It’s my life. I was there. I lived it. I wasn’t watching from afar or learning about it through social media. ""I went hungry. I saw my sister grow up without proper nutrition during the most-important years of her life. I saw people get killed for thinking differently. I watched the regime control the narrative through national television and manipulate people because they own the media. Those things don’t leave you,"" Caldera said. Caldera added that her whole family is still in Venezuela, and she opposes bombings and military interventions, but she said that seeing Maduro captured has brought ""a sense of relief."" ""There’s also been a lot of hate directed at Venezuelans; comments like, 'see you in six months crying,' as if people are waiting for us to fail, or mocking us for feeling relief or hope. That cruelty is exhausting,"" Caldera added. ""And, on top of that, there’s this assumption that we’re ignorant—that we don’t understand history or the consequences of foreign intervention, as if we haven’t read, learned, or thought deeply about these things ourselves. We have. Disagreeing is fine. Erasing our intelligence and our pain is not. ""I don’t mind discussion. I don’t mind disagreement. What hurts is when someone tries to explain to me something I survived, or tells me how I should feel about it,"" Caldera said. Venezuelasplaining Andrea Martínez, 33, works as a language teacher in Paris, France. She fled Caracas as a political refugee when she was 21. She told Newsweek about first hearing about the situation from her father, and hearing the explosions—she cried out of fear, but then felt joy that Maduro had been captured. ""We’ve been asking everyone for help for a very long time, knocking on every door; no one opened. Taking into account that we do not have the weapons to make this happen ourselves, I’m glad someone did. Is this my best-case scenario? Absolutely not,"" Martínez said. In response to creators who have warned about the U.S. exploiting their oil, she cited the long history of international interference with their natural resource. ""The contempt in their voices is loud. We have been raising our voices for 26 years, and we haven’t been heard. Everyone seems to care about the oil, but we haven’t seen a dime from that oil in decades. It’s a nightmare; I’d gladly negotiate part of the oil to stop starvation, or if it meant we could have torture centers closed down. ""It’s hard to think about the oil when your friends are being tortured. I will not engage in one-to-one conversations where someone feels like it’s OK to Venezuelasplain the situation to me,"" Martínez said. ' I’ve Been in a Great State of Distress ' Not all Venezuelans agree. A 27-year-old, who is half Venezuelan and half British and preferred to remain anonymous, voiced concern regarding American intervention. She grew up between a town in the Andes called Estado Trujillo and London, and underlined her family moved for personal reasons, not economic or political ones. She said her grandparents passed away in 2017 due to medical shortages she believes were invoked by U.S. sanctions. ""I hope the world can wake up and look beyond the propaganda that shows the U.S. as the world’s savior,"" she told Newsweek . ""Not only is Chavez greatly popular in Venezuela to this day, with many grassroots activists still seeing him as an inspiration despite the government increasingly shifting away from his ideas; but also the idea spread that the removal of Maduro done by the U.S. is a good thing in the long run is laughable,"" the woman said. ""I’ve been in a state of great distress, both over not being in the country to join the protests and over the views I have seen expressed online, mostly from Americans, Europeans and Venezuelan Americans,"" she added. 'We Leave Ideals Aside' A source, who prefers to remain anonymous, lives in Caracas and witnessed the explosion firsthand.

""When we learned about what was happening, we knew we were extremely happy and alleviated by the fact the dictator was gone, but also concerned because this did not necessarily imply the crumbling of the whole criminal tyranny,"" the woman added. She voiced her hopes that the citizens can make their way toward a democracy following Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election, in which opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia was recognized as the winner by the U.S. and several international observers. However, the result was rejected by the Maduro government, which claimed victory. The woman said: ""When we argue that foreigners won’t be able to relate to our story, we refer to their lack of lived experience and profound feelings on the subject […] And that’s precisely why we hold that you can’t explain Venezuela to Venezuelans.

And believe me when I say we recognize that none of this is the ideal scenario nor the ideal solutions, but, after so much suffering, injustice, and goodbyes, we leave ideals aside and start focusing on a more-pragmatic approach toward our democratic future,"" she added. 'Please Pray for Us' Mari Angela Serrano (@ mariangelaserrano ), 29, a Venezuelan dancer now based in Portland, Oregon, has taken to TikTok to share her belief that two things can be true at once: Venezuelans can feel relief that a dictator has been removed; while also fearing what comes next. Serrano said much of the online commentary reduces the situation to abstract political theory rather than lived reality, arguing that, while outside observers may logically analyze the situation, they underestimate the depth of trauma Venezuelans carry. Serrano added that the idea of U.S. involvement—including Trump’s claim that he is temporarily governing Venezuela—is frightening, but she said many Venezuelans feel safer under international oversight than before. Serrano said: ""Many of us do not support President Trump, yet we're still thankful for what happened. And that's a weird thing to navigate, too. So it is frustrating when you see people treating Venezuelans, like, 'Are you all stupid? Don't you realize that they're going to steal your resources?' ""But what people don't get is, 'No, you don't know what it's like to live in fear every single day, because of your political beliefs.' People don't get it; they really don't. I have hope for our people and our humanity,"" Serrano added. ""We're just happy that something got done. We've never come this far. So we're just taking things as they come. ""Please hope for the best for us […] Please pray for us,"" she said.

As for the virality of the news, Bello said she feels excited that their voices are being heard internationally, but frustrated that it has taken over 25 years. ""It’s disheartening to see people use our crisis as a debate topic for international politics rather than a platform for our suffering,"" Bello said.

Related Podcasts Top Stories Trending     Opinion    ","Venezuelans Tell ‘Privileged’ Americans: Stop Explaining Our Struggle Life & Trends Reporter Since news of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro’s extradition on January 3, the geopolitical drama has sparked a social-media theatrical storm. As global spectators scramble to understand what is unfolding, commentators have rushed to share hot takes and 'simple' explainers. However, many Venezuelans have criticized this rapid algorithmic response—and attempt to ""Venezuelasplain"" their history—as condescending and belittling. What Has Happened in Venezuela? On January 3, the U.S. launched a shock, large-scale strike against Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Maduro was arrested and extradited to New York, where he remains imprisoned. He pleaded not guilty to drug charges and declared he had been ""kidnapped."" The Venezuelan vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, has been named interim president. President Trump announced that the U.S. is ""going to run the country, until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,"" but many have condemned the military action, with many legal experts and politicians around the world deeming it unlawful. Anna Kelly, the White House's deputy press secretary, told Newsweek : ""The successful rendition of Nicolas Maduro to the United States to answer for his lifetime of crimes was lawful. As in prior administrations, the entire Trump Administration coordinated to arrest the head of a major narcotrafficking Foreign Terrorist Organization, who has long been a fugitive of American justice. Once again, President Trump‘s decisive leadership will result in peace in the world."" In 1998, Hugo Chávez was elected and moved to bring Venezuela’s oil industry under state control. After his death in 2013, Nicolás Maduro succeeded him. Maduro’s 2018 reelection was widely disputed, as was his 2024 victory. Protests followed, with thousands arrested, including human rights defenders and journalists. Amnesty International said that, between July 28 and August 1, following the presidential election, at least 24 people died during anti-government protests. Two of the casualties were children, and one a police officer. By the end of that year, more than 7.89 million Venezuelans had fled the country. Many have taken to TikTok, asking Americans and Westerners to stop telling them how to feel about Maduro's ousting—which many are happy about, despite the ethical and legal complexities. The Confluence of a Complicated History ""We live in an era where content is incentivized by clicks and likes on the topic du jour, which pulls influencers into spheres where they may have no knowledge or expertise. Social media rewards simplistic hot takes, not complex content,"" Dr. Christine J. Wade, a specialist in the international and comparative politics of Latin America at Washington College, told Newsweek . Wade said that there is not a single Venezuelan story, but rather ""the confluence of a complicated history."" ""How are influencers who couldn’t find Venezuela on a map a week ago supposed to navigate this?"" Wade asked. Speaking with Newsweek , Venezuelans shared their frustrations over having their history explained to them. 'Disagreeing Is Fine. Erasing Our Intelligence and Our Pain Is Not' Anna Caldera ( @pelonacibernetica) , 26, grew up in a small town called Guatire and then moved to Catia in the capital of Caracas. In November 2023, she moved to Barcelona, Spain. She has created multiple videos on the subject; her most-viral take garnered over 1.8 million views and called out ""privileged"" people for attempting to explain the Venezuelan struggle to her. Caldera told Newsweek : ""The closest way I can explain how it feels is like being mansplained about your own body—except this is my country. It’s my life. I was there. I lived it. I wasn’t watching from afar or learning about it through social media. ""I went hungry. I saw my sister grow up without proper nutrition during the most-important years of her life. I saw people get killed for thinking differently. I watched the regime control the narrative through national television and manipulate people because they own the media. Those things don’t leave you,"" Caldera said. Caldera added that her whole family is still in Venezuela, and she opposes bombings and military interventions, but she said that seeing Maduro captured has brought ""a sense of relief."" ""There’s also been a lot of hate directed at Venezuelans; comments like, 'see you in six months crying,' as if people are waiting for us to fail, or mocking us for feeling relief or hope. That cruelty is exhausting,"" Caldera added. ""And, on top of that, there’s this assumption that we’re ignorant—that we don’t understand history or the consequences of foreign intervention, as if we haven’t read, learned, or thought deeply about these things ourselves. We have. Disagreeing is fine. Erasing our intelligence and our pain is not. ""I don’t mind discussion. I don’t mind disagreement. What hurts is when someone tries to explain to me something I survived, or tells me how I should feel about it,"" Caldera said. Venezuelasplaining Andrea Martínez, 33, works as a language teacher in Paris, France. She fled Caracas as a political refugee when she was 21. She told Newsweek about first hearing about the situation from her father, and hearing the explosions—she cried out of fear, but then felt joy that Maduro had been captured. ""We’ve been asking everyone for help for a very long time, knocking on every door; no one opened. Taking into account that we do not have the weapons to make this happen ourselves, I’m glad someone did. Is this my best-case scenario? Absolutely not,"" Martínez said. In response to creators who have warned about the U.S. exploiting their oil, she cited the long history of international interference with their natural resource. ""The contempt in their voices is loud. We have been raising our voices for 26 years, and we haven’t been heard. Everyone seems to care about the oil, but we haven’t seen a dime from that oil in decades. It’s a nightmare; I’d gladly negotiate part of the oil to stop starvation, or if it meant we could have torture centers closed down. ""It’s hard to think about the oil when your friends are being tortured. I will not engage in one-to-one conversations where someone feels like it’s OK to Venezuelasplain the situation to me,"" Martínez said. ' I’ve Been in a Great State of Distress ' Not all Venezuelans agree. A 27-year-old, who is half Venezuelan and half British and preferred to remain anonymous, voiced concern regarding American intervention. She grew up between a town in the Andes called Estado Trujillo and London, and underlined her family moved for personal reasons, not economic or political ones. She said her grandparents passed away in 2017 due to medical shortages she believes were invoked by U.S. sanctions. ""I hope the world can wake up and look beyond the propaganda that shows the U.S. as the world’s savior,"" she told Newsweek . ""Not only is Chavez greatly popular in Venezuela to this day, with many grassroots activists still seeing him as an inspiration despite the government increasingly shifting away from his ideas; but also the idea spread that the removal of Maduro done by the U.S. is a good thing in the long run is laughable,"" the woman said. ""I’ve been in a state of great distress, both over not being in the country to join the protests and over the views I have seen expressed online, mostly from Americans, Europeans and Venezuelan Americans,"" she added. 'We Leave Ideals Aside' A source, who prefers to remain anonymous, lives in Caracas and witnessed the explosion firsthand. ""I heard the first superloud bang and, when I woke up, I immediately saw and heard the flames and detonations all around the city,"" she told Newsweek . ""When we learned about what was happening, we knew we were extremely happy and alleviated by the fact the dictator was gone, but also concerned because this did not necessarily imply the crumbling of the whole criminal tyranny,"" the woman added. She voiced her hopes that the citizens can make their way toward a democracy following Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election, in which opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia was recognized as the winner by the U.S. and several international observers.

With both players' contracts expiring at the end of the season, the Mariners were left with big decisions to make. They quickly re-signed Naylor to a new deal, but it doesn't seem like Suárez will have the same fate. Nick Selbe and Will Laws of Sports Illustrated predicted Suárez would bolt from Seattle and sign a deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates this winter. ""Suárez ranked fifth in the majors with 49 home runs in 2025, but there are quite a few warning signs about the slugger’s longevity,"" Laws and Selbe wrote. ""He’s long been one of the most whiff-prone hitters in the league, his production cratered after a midseason return to the Mariners and his defense is already poor enough that his glove is best kept in his locker. ""All that said, he could make a massive difference in the middle of the lineup on a short-term deal for an offense-starved team like the suddenly active Pirates if everything goes right."" The Pirates have been abnormally aggressive this offseason. They've made a trade to bring in Brandon Lowe while also spending some money in free agency to land Ryan O'Hearn. Considering Suárez is projected to sign for well under $100 million, the Pirates could make a real run at the slugger. Suárez would fit perfectly in the middle of their lineup while plugging a massive hole at third base.

They quickly re-signed Naylor to a new deal, but it doesn't seem like Suárez will have the same fate. Nick Selbe and Will Laws of Sports Illustrated predicted Suárez would bolt from Seattle and sign a deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates this winter. ""Suárez ranked fifth in the majors with 49 home runs in 2025, but there are quite a few warning signs about the slugger’s longevity,"" Laws and Selbe wrote. ""He’s long been one of the most whiff-prone hitters in the league, his production cratered after a midseason return to the Mariners and his defense is already poor enough that his glove is best kept in his locker. ""All that said, he could make a massive difference in the middle of the lineup on a short-term deal for an offense-starved team like the suddenly active Pirates if everything goes right."" The Pirates have been abnormally aggressive this offseason. They've made a trade to bring in Brandon Lowe while also spending some money in free agency to land Ryan O'Hearn. Considering Suárez is projected to sign for well under $100 million, the Pirates could make a real run at the slugger. Suárez would fit perfectly in the middle of their lineup while plugging a massive hole at third base. The idea makes perfect sense, but it's still up in the air if the Pirates will take this big of a swing in free agency.

newsweek,Barack Obama More Popular with Young Men Than Joe Rogan or Donald Trump,"Obama is the most popular political figure among young men, according to a new poll.",https://www.newsweek.com/barack-obama-more-popular-with-young-men-than-joe-rogan-or-donald-trump-11329827,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:12:40 -0500",2026-01-08 11:12:40-05:00,"Weekend Staff Writer Former President Barack Obama remains the most popular political figure among young men, and is viewed more favorably than people including President Donald Trump and Joe Rogan, according to a new poll. Newsweek reached out to the White House, a spokesperson for Rogan and Obama’s office for comment via email. Why It Matters Young men shifted rightward in the 2024 presidential race, giving Trump a plurality of their vote over former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to exit polling data. This represents a shift from previous elections, when they were viewed as a more solidly Democratic demographic. Obama’s enduring approval could signal how Democrats could build back support among younger men ahead of upcoming elections, when they will likely be a key voter group. What to Know In 2024, men between the ages of 18 and 29 gave Trump 49 percent of their vote, and Harris 48 percent support, according to CNN exit polls. That marks an improvement in Trump’s performance compared to 2020, when that same group backed former President Joe Biden by 11 points in the 2020 election (52 percent to 41 percent). A new poll, conducted by Democrats’ group Speaking With American Men and first reported by Puck News, showed that Obama remains popular among the demographic. It found that 56 percent of respondents viewed Obama positively. YouTuber MrBeast follows with 55 percent favorability. A smaller plurality, 53 percent, view Rogan, a popular podcaster, favorably, while only 46 percent view Trump favorably. Thirty-three percent said they view Vice President JD Vance favorably. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is viewed favorably by 39 percent of respondents. Andrew Tate, an influencer who denies charges of rape in the U.K and Romania, is viewed favorably by 35 percent. Meanwhile, 26 percent said they view California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is widely seen as a potential presidential candidate, positively, while 17 percent view Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem positively, the poll found. It surveyed 3,460 young men between the ages of 16 and 29 from October 28 to November 6, 2025. Trump’s media strategy of appearing on podcasts popular with Gen Z men, including that hosted by Rogan, has been attributed with bolstering his performance among young men in 2024 . What People Are Saying White House spokesperson Davis Ingle, when reached by Newsweek for comment on the poll Thursday: ""President Trump was overwhelmingly elected by nearly 80 million Americans to deliver on his popular and common sense agenda. The President has already made historic progress not only in America but around the world. It is not surprising that President Trump remains the most dominant figure in American politics."" The Speaking With American Men report reads: ""In the wake of the 2024 election, many observers interpreted changes among young men as a political shift. Our findings point to a deeper and more personal reality. Young men are first reassessing identity, belonging, and their place in the world; political attitudes are following, not leading. While many continue to support Democratic-aligned policies, growing numbers feel disconnected from political leadership and unsure that anyone in power understands their lived experience."" President Donald Trump said on Truth Social in November: ""So many Fake Polls are being shown by the Radical Left Media, all slanted heavily toward Democrats and Far Left Wingers…Fake News will never change, they are evil and corrupt but, as I look around my beautiful surroundings, I say to myself, 'Oh, look, I’m sitting in the Oval Office!'"" What Happens Next Young men are likely to remain a critical group targeted by both Democrats and Republicans. The 2026 midterms in November will be the Democrats’ next test as to whether they are able to win back young male voters.

newsweek,9 Republican Senators Rebuke Donald Trump&#039;s Greenland Threats,Senator Mitch McConnell called the threats &quot;unseemly&quot; as the White House pushes for U.S. control of the Danish territory.,https://www.newsweek.com/republican-senators-rebuke-donald-trump-greenland-threats-11330067,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:11:38 -0500",2026-01-08 11:11:38-05:00,"Politics Reporter President Donald Trump may be losing some support in his party amid his continued threats to take over Greenland. Nine Republican senators have so far spoken publicly against the idea , including Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell and Louisiana’s John Kennedy. “Threats and intimidation by U.S. officials over American ownership of Greenland are as unseemly as they are counterproductive,” McConnell said in a statement Wednesday. “And the use of force to seize the sovereign democratic territory of one of America’s most loyal and capable allies would be an especially catastrophic act of strategic self-harm to America and its global influence.” Why It Matters Greenland has been a target for Trump since his first term, but the idea of America seeking to influence, or control, other countries does not sit well with some Republicans . The president ran on a campaign promise of peace and to end wars rather than start them, but recent actions in Venezuela , Iran and now potentially Greenland are causing some supporters to doubt him. What To Know Republicans in Congress appear divided over whether or not the U.S. should take control of the Danish territory, with Trump and others in the White House arguing that it is necessary for American national security and floating the possibility of military action to achieve the goal. On Tuesday, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune downplayed the talk, telling reporters: “I don’t see military action being an option there.…That, to me, is not something anybody is contemplating seriously at this point.” More GOP voices have emerged, including McConnell and Kennedy, with the latter telling CNN on Wednesday that “even a modestly intelligent ninth-grader knows that to invade Greenland would be weapons-grade stupid.” Rand Paul , the Kentucky senator who has often criticized Trump, said on CBS Mornings that military action in Greenland would not happen under his watch. “Party aside, the Constitution is clear: Congress authorizes war,” Paul said on X following the interview. “That safeguard exists for a reason—even when we agree with the outcome.” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said on X on Tuesday that she hoped Trump’s rhetorics was “nothing more than posturing,” adding that “any effort to claim or take the territory by force would degrade both our national security and our international relationships.” Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas said this week that the U.S. should not “take over another country that’s our ally.” That fear has been reflected by NATO leaders, who have issued multiple statements urging the U.S. not to put the bloc’s security and future at risk. “This is a topic that should be dropped,” Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi said, adding that the Trump administration should not antagonize NATO allies. Wicker’s colleague, Maine Senator Susan Collins, who chairs the Appropriations Committee, also said the Trump administration should drop the idea, saying: “It makes no sense whatsoever.” North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis directly targeted White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Trump Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller and his comments about Greenland, saying he was “sick of stupid,” adding that “the amateurs who said it’s a good idea [to invade Greenland] should lose their jobs.” Miller had said that no one was going to fight the U.S. militarily over Greenland and its future. Utah Senator John Curtis took to X Wednesday to say military action was not the way forward. “Strengthening our partnership with Denmark and Greenland and working with our allies to secure the Arctic is in America’s national interest,” he posted. “Military force is not appropriate, not necessary, and not something I will support. Full stop.” The pushback from GOP members of Congress comes after Trump ordered military actions in Venezuela last week, capturing President Nicolas Maduro and his wife and transporting them to New York on federal charges without first seeking approval from Congress. Trump has followed that by saying the U.S. will run Venezuela and have control over its oil production and profits, despite the initial operations in the area framed around drug-smuggling concerns. The White House has said that Russian and Chinese vessels off the coast of Greenland are a concern, but the island is also rich in natural resources. What People Are Saying White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Newsweek on Tuesday: ""The President and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief’s disposal.” Stephen Miller, on CNN on Monday: ""Obviously, Greenland should be part of the United States."" United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, on Monday: “Let me be very clear on the U.K. position. Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, our close European partners and longstanding NATO allies. And all our countries work closely together on security issues and will always do so. The future of Greenland is a matter for the Greenlanders and Danes and no one else.” Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, on Monday night: “We are not in a situation where we think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.""

He revealed that he has been diagnosed with early onset Parkinson’s disease. The former ECW World Champion, known for his psychological mastery and grunge-inspired character. He opened up about the condition during a recent appearance on "" Insight with Chris Van Vliet ."" Despite the medical diagnosis, the 61-year-old is adopting a unique and defiant mental approach to the illness. He admitted to experiencing tremors for nearly a decade but has chosen to mentally reject the label of the disease itself. “It’s good. I mean, I got the early onset Parkinson’s, which I’m of the mind to say that I don’t have it. But it’s why I have the tremor, and that’s what they think it is. There’s no 100% proof tests, so I didn’t get tested. I’m just going to declare that I’m not, that I don’t have early onset Parkinson’s and then convince myself that I don’t, because I’ve had it for like 8 to 10 years, and all this is a tremor so far. I figure mind over matter,” Raven explained. The veteran grappler was candid about the likely causes of his current state. Having spent decades performing an unforgiving style that often involved unprotected blows to the head, Raven acknowledged that his past choices are catching up with him. He views his current health struggles as the invoice coming due for a life lived on the edge. “I’m sure, from years of drug abuse and chair shots to the head and stuff like that, and abusing my body, I’m sure this is the price I’m paying,” he said. Beyond the tremors, Raven detailed a debilitating sleep disorder that severely impacts his quality of life. He described a nightly routine where rest is fragmented and fleeting, requiring the use of a specialized CPAP machine just to breathe properly. “I go to bed, I can fall asleep, no problem. But then I start waking up. After about two hours, I’ll wake up, and I’ll wake up like every 20 minutes for the next six to eight hours,” he noted, adding that the cycle leaves him perpetually exhausted. Despite his deep history in the business, Raven also revealed that he has completely detached from the modern product. He no longer watches professional wrestling, citing his personality as a ""completist"" who cannot just watch casually. “Watching wrestling would just take up way too much time. I’m already addicted enough to the UFC and MMA, to get addicted back to wrestling again would be too much,” he stated.

I’m already addicted enough to the UFC and MMA, to get addicted back to wrestling again would be too much,” he stated.

newsweek,"Experts Behind New Food Pyramid Have Ties To Beef, Dairy Industries",The U.S. dietary guidelines on January 7 sparked backlash over the beef and dairy ties in the expert panel shaping food advice.,https://www.newsweek.com/experts-behind-new-food-pyramid-ties-beef-dairy-industries-11328283,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:06:48 -0500",2026-01-08 11:06:48-05:00,"Life and Trends Reporter The U.S. government ’s new dietary guidelines, released this week, are under scrutiny after it emerged that some of the experts behind the recommendations have financial ties to the beef and dairy industries. The Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture published the ""Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2025-2030"" on January 7. Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy , Jr., signed off the update with Brooke L. Rollins, secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The new guidelines call for a return to ""whole, nutrient-dense foods"" and warn that chronic disease linked to poor diet is driving nearly 90 percent of U.S. health care spending. Newsweek spoke with a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson. They did not comment on how some of the experts consulted align with different food companies but did say that the ""nutrition scientists and subject matter experts"" involved were selected through a federal contradicting process based on demonstrated expertise. The spokesperson clarified that the experts' views were thoroughly reviewed through an external peer review process coordinated by The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Nutrition Research. Reviewers were selected on experience and absence of ""conflicts of interest,"" while review authors are said to have addressed all peer-review comments, revising their analyses accordingly.

Review authors from a variety of academic institutions and hospitals were shown to have affiliations with several dairy and meat groups, including Global Dairy Platform, Danone's subsidiary Nutricia, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Texas Beef Council, American Dairy Science Association, Seafood Nutrition Partnership National Dairy Council and National Pork Board. The guidelines emphasize more protein and less sugar and ultra-processed foods, while leaving long-standing advice on saturated fat unchanged.

newsweek,Inside Luxe Recovery’s Mission to Put Empathy at the Center of Care,"At a Los Angeles treatment center built on lived experience, empathy isn’t a buzzword—it’s policy guiding every stage of recovery.",https://www.newsweek.com/inside-luxe-recoverys-mission-to-put-empathy-at-the-center-of-care-11316295,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:00:00 -0500",2026-01-08 11:00:00-05:00,"AI Editor When Luxe Recovery first opened its doors in Los Angeles, there was no master plan, just two people determined to do things differently. Frank Wills had been sober for only four months, and his business partner knew little about addiction treatment but a lot about running a business. From the start, Wills and his business partner centered on one guiding principle: clients before profit. The idea came from seeing how other facilities operated, where people were often treated like numbers instead of individuals. “We didn’t know what the f--- we were doing,” Wills told Newsweek . “A lot of learning curve, feeling the industry out, understanding what was expected from insurances. The industry changes constantly, and we’ve had to keep adjusting.” Luxe’s founders agreed they wanted to build something that treated people, not policies. They set empathy as their north star, an approach that shaped hiring, culture and care. “From the beginning, empathy was number one,” he said. “Ninety percent of the people coming in are ass----- because they’re high or coming down. They’re not bad people; they’re at their worst. So, we told our staff: empathy, empathy, empathy. Don’t forget, most of you were there once, too.” Within just four years, Luxe Recovery earned recognition as one of Newsweek’s top addiction treatment centers , proof that what began as a small, chaotic experiment could evolve into a nationally respected model. Today, Luxe operates multiple treatment homes in Los Angeles and is preparing to launch a 10,000-square-foot outpatient center designed to extend its continuum of care through detox, residential, PHP, IOP and sober living programs. A Leader Forged by Recovery Wills’s own story is woven into Luxe’s foundation. After years of addiction and relapse, he knew the shame and stigma that often overshadow people in recovery. “In recovery, they like to say we don’t shoot our wounded, but that’s not the case,” he reflected. “I’ve been shot so many times. I never wanted to be that individual that looked down on people for not being able to stay stopped.” That mindset now defines Luxe’s culture. Wills tells staff that every client who arrives on their “last rope” deserves love, compassion and empathy. “If they’re incapable, they’re not with us,” he added. Wills personally selects most of the company’s employees and makes it a point to know them well. “I have a personal relationship with them,” he said. “I know how they walk and talk outside of the recovery element, in meetings and outside meetings. I know how they are with their children, their spouses, their parents.” That personal connection ensures the empathy shown to clients isn’t performative, it’s lived. Continuity of Care, Continuity of Trust Luxe’s success rests on a principle often missing in the treatment world: continuity. In a system where most programs end after 30 days, because that’s what insurance covers, Luxe extends care through outpatient programs and sober living homes, so clients stay connected to the same team throughout their recovery journey. “They’re here for 30 days, more or less—30 to 45—and then they go to our PHP or IOP, and they have the same therapist for the next six months,” he explained. In many traditional programs, clients have to start over with new doctors, new nurses and new therapists every time they move to the next stage of care, retelling painful stories to people who don’t yet know them. Luxe was built to stop that cycle. By keeping the same care team throughout treatment, the company aims to make recovery feel continuous, not fragmented. To strengthen that trust, Luxe only places graduates of its own programs in its sober living homes. “Most sober livings in L.A. are a sh-- show,” he noted. “We don’t take anybody from outside. Everyone there has gone through our program.” That consistency gives clients the best chance to succeed. “They’ve already built trust, and they stay surrounded by people who know exactly what they’re going through.” Turning Compassion into Company Culture Scaling empathy isn’t easy, but Luxe’s hiring and training practices make it the company’s defining strength. Many employees are in recovery themselves, something Wills considers essential. “We’ve got some people that were unhirable,” he emphasized. “Our person who does our admissions now—she was just sharing about not being able to keep a job because of her background washing toilets. We took this individual and gave her a shot. Now she does our admissions.” One nurse first came through treatment, did the work and now leads nursing. “You can’t buy that kind of loyalty,” he said. “They want to do good for you because you have done good for them.” Wills maintains a constant presence across facilities. “I try to go to at least one of the facilities every week,” he shared. “I go, I’m there, I’m present.” Every Tuesday morning, Luxe holds an all-hands clinical meeting to review each client’s progress and identify ways to improve care. He meets regularly with all program directors, medical and clinical staff to ensure communication and accountability remain strong. The result is an atmosphere where people want to show up. “A lot of the time, it doesn’t feel like work,” he explained. “It’s something we all enjoy doing.” Scaling With a Soul Unlike many treatment centers that expand rapidly, Luxe’s growth has been methodical. Each facility is allowed to mature before the next one opens, ensuring that culture, systems and staff remain aligned with the company’s values. “We could open more facilities, but we don’t rush it,” he stressed to Newsweek . “Every new location runs at least a year before we even think about expanding again. We make sure the staff, the clients, the systems—everything—is right.” To maintain accountability, Luxe brings in independent auditors to inspect each facility regularly. “They act like the state,” he noted. “They give us a full report, from staff to medication logs. We don’t open another place until those reports are where we want them.” Leadership at new sites typically comes from within Luxe. Staff who embody the program’s principles are promoted to run facilities, passing on what they’ve learned. “Somebody that was already working there, through and through, will go and teach their own team,” he said. “They know exactly how we do things, what the culture needs to look like.” That steady approach is now culminating in Luxe’s newest milestone, a 10,000-square-foot outpatient headquarters in central Los Angeles that includes therapy rooms, group spaces and corporate offices. Wills calls it “a reward for doing things the right way.” A Blueprint for Compassionate Care Wills doesn’t view Luxe as just a business; it’s a model for what recovery care can be when compassion outweighs profit. “What other centers could learn from us,” he said, “is to take care of their clients first, before they take care of themselves. The money will come.” That philosophy extends to how Luxe treats its employees. The company supports staff who face personal or family challenges, making sure they feel cared for the same way clients do. “We take care of our people,” he said. “And when we do that, they take care of the business.” Many of those employees once faced homelessness or chronic relapse. One woman who was homeless when she joined Luxe now manages a team and earns six figures. Another staff member recently reunited with his daughter after three years, with the company’s help navigating the process. For Wills, that’s the true measure of success. “At the very end of the day, it’s a business,” he said. “But we are in the business of building and molding and shaping human beings and helping them turn into the individual that they were intended to be.” Discover more about their programs and services by visiting luxerecoveryla.com or luxerecovery.com .

newsweek,Will Serial Killer Be Released From Jail Next Month? Experts Weigh In,"Jack Wayne Reeves will be eligible for parole next month, but experts said he faces challenges in securing his release.",https://www.newsweek.com/will-serial-killer-be-released-from-jail-next-month-jack-reeves-11329803,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:53:13 -0500",2026-01-08 10:53:13-05:00,"News Reporter A convicted serial killer in Texas will be eligible for parole for the first time next month, but experts told Newsweek that he faces some challenges in securing his release. Jack Wayne Reeves , who is serving sentences of 35 years and 99 years in the Wallace Pack Unit for two murder convictions, is eligible for parole on February 6, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice records. Wes Ball, who served as Reeves’s attorney in his two murder trials and on direct appeal, spoke to Newsweek about the possibility of Reeves receiving parole. “Texas’ parole authorities don’t tend to lean favorably to granting parole in this type of a case, and that’s been my experience over decades of criminal law practice in Texas, but each case is unique,” Ball said. Gary Cohen, a Texas attorney specializing in the representation of inmates in the parole review process, told Newsweek that Reeves's ""chances of getting released on his first event, with a history like his, they are in the single digits. He is not going to get out this time.” Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told Newsweek that Reeves has “little to no chance of receiving parole.” “Texas is pretty strict when it comes to these parole cases,"" Rahmani said. Why It Matters Reeves was convicted of killing a man in Italy, his second wife, Sharon Vaughn, and his fourth wife, Emilita Villa. He is currently serving sentences related to the killings of Vaughn and Villa. Reeves's case has received media and public attention. His case was featured on several television shows, including Exhumed on Oxygen and Forensic Files . He was also the subject of a 1999 book titled Mail Order Murder . What To Know Cohen told Newsweek that the parole board is free to examine factors beyond the inmate’s convictions. “They are free to look at everything in an individual’s life in terms of prior criminal conduct, prior criminal convictions, they can look at counts that may have been dismissed as part of plea agreement,” Cohen said. “There’s nothing that’s off limit for them in terms of making a decision about a person.” Cohen said the parole board will also examine the inmate’s time in confinement. He said the board will consider factors such as, “Have they been compliant with the rules? What kind of programming have they participated in?” Victims and their families also have a right to share their feelings about the individual being released with the parole board, Cohen said. Reeves is now 85 years old, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice records. Rahmani said his age could play a role in the parole decision. “If there’s health issues, that is something the parole board can consider, so that’s something that would probably help him in getting released, advanced age,” Rahmani said. “I would still be surprised if they granted it.” Cohen said psychological data in the criminal justice field shows that the risk of “aberrant or anti-social behavior” decreases as an individual gets older. “You tend to be more calm, but Texas really doesn’t give a damn. That is not going to be a significant factor in his release,” Cohen said. What People Are Saying Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told Newsweek : “I would be surprised if the Texas board deemed him parole eligible. I mean, they look at the nature and circumstances of the offense. Killing your wife or killing multiple wives, that’s pretty egregious and heinous.” Wes Ball, who served as Jack Wayne Reeves’s attorney in his two murder trials and on direct appeal, told Newsweek : “Texas is not known for being generous with parole for homicide cases.” What Happens Next Reeves is eligible for parole on February 6, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice records.

Experts Weigh In News Reporter A convicted serial killer in Texas will be eligible for parole for the first time next month, but experts told Newsweek that he faces some challenges in securing his release. Jack Wayne Reeves , who is serving sentences of 35 years and 99 years in the Wallace Pack Unit for two murder convictions, is eligible for parole on February 6, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice records. Wes Ball, who served as Reeves’s attorney in his two murder trials and on direct appeal, spoke to Newsweek about the possibility of Reeves receiving parole. “Texas’ parole authorities don’t tend to lean favorably to granting parole in this type of a case, and that’s been my experience over decades of criminal law practice in Texas, but each case is unique,” Ball said. Gary Cohen, a Texas attorney specializing in the representation of inmates in the parole review process, told Newsweek that Reeves's ""chances of getting released on his first event, with a history like his, they are in the single digits. He is not going to get out this time.” Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told Newsweek that Reeves has “little to no chance of receiving parole.” “Texas is pretty strict when it comes to these parole cases,"" Rahmani said. Why It Matters Reeves was convicted of killing a man in Italy, his second wife, Sharon Vaughn, and his fourth wife, Emilita Villa. He is currently serving sentences related to the killings of Vaughn and Villa. Reeves's case has received media and public attention. His case was featured on several television shows, including Exhumed on Oxygen and Forensic Files . He was also the subject of a 1999 book titled Mail Order Murder . What To Know Cohen told Newsweek that the parole board is free to examine factors beyond the inmate’s convictions. “They are free to look at everything in an individual’s life in terms of prior criminal conduct, prior criminal convictions, they can look at counts that may have been dismissed as part of plea agreement,” Cohen said. “There’s nothing that’s off limit for them in terms of making a decision about a person.” Cohen said the parole board will also examine the inmate’s time in confinement. He said the board will consider factors such as, “Have they been compliant with the rules? What kind of programming have they participated in?” Victims and their families also have a right to share their feelings about the individual being released with the parole board, Cohen said. Reeves is now 85 years old, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice records. Rahmani said his age could play a role in the parole decision. “If there’s health issues, that is something the parole board can consider, so that’s something that would probably help him in getting released, advanced age,” Rahmani said. “I would still be surprised if they granted it.” Cohen said psychological data in the criminal justice field shows that the risk of “aberrant or anti-social behavior” decreases as an individual gets older. “You tend to be more calm, but Texas really doesn’t give a damn. That is not going to be a significant factor in his release,” Cohen said. What People Are Saying Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told Newsweek : “I would be surprised if the Texas board deemed him parole eligible. I mean, they look at the nature and circumstances of the offense. Killing your wife or killing multiple wives, that’s pretty egregious and heinous.” Wes Ball, who served as Jack Wayne Reeves’s attorney in his two murder trials and on direct appeal, told Newsweek : “Texas is not known for being generous with parole for homicide cases.” What Happens Next Reeves is eligible for parole on February 6, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice records.

In a viral TikTok video shared in December by @2catbros, the tuxedo cat can be seen looking sleepy on his car ride back home—but then everything changes once he actually gets there. “He is probably going to be very drowsy after anesthesia , give him time to rest,"" reads layover text in the clip. Just 45 minutes later, the kitty can be seen sprinting across the living room, jumping all over the place instead of getting some good rest. “I AM FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE WITH THIS KITTEN TONIGHT!!!! he is reacting INSANE to the anesthesia! Will not keep his collar on, biting me, howling, will not stop being active, begging for food, I cannot get him to rest at all!” the caption says. “I have a safe space set up in the half bath, but his surgery onsie will not be here until tomorrow. Send me well wishes.” VCA Animal Hospitals says that after surgery, cats should be almost completely back to normal by the time they are discharged, although many cats are sleepy or tired for 12 to 24 hours after anesthesia. After surgery, cats should be kept warm, comfortable, and indoors in a quiet room. Activity must be restricted for seven–10 days to prevent strain on the wound. Small, divided meals can be offered a few hours after returning home, as anesthesia may cause mild nausea. A mild cough may occur from the breathing tube used during anesthesia and typically resolves within a few days. The incision should appear clean with edges together—slight redness or bruising is common. Owners should watch for swelling, discharge, odor, or persistent bleeding. Licking or chewing the wound requires an E‑collar or recovery suit. Stitches are usually removed within seven to 14 days unless dissolvable sutures were used. Pain medications should be given exactly as directed by your veterinarian. The video quickly went viral on social media and it has so far received over 547,300 views and 60,600 likes on the platform. One user, Bri.and.ld, commented: “This face told me exactly how the rest of the video was about to go.” Cookbooking said: “Mine hurt his leg and was in no uncertain terms not to jump or make a lot of movement as a tiny kitten.

newsweek,Donald Trump Issues Ultimatum To California Amid Major Fraud Probe,California’s child care programs won’t be able to access federal funding until they can prove they’re not committing fraud.,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-issues-ultimatum-to-california-amid-major-fraud-probe-11328692,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:48:19 -0500",2026-01-08 10:48:19-05:00,"Senior Housing Reporter The Trump administration has frozen federal funding for California’s child care and social services programs until the state proves that "" extensive and systemic fraud ” is not being committed within its system. In a letter addressed to Governor Gavin Newsom and shared with Newsweek , the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said it ""has reason to believe” the state ""is illicitly providing illegal aliens” with benefits ""intended for American citizens and lawful permanent residents.” California officials have pushed back on the allegations made by the Trump administration, which has also frozen federal funds for child care and social services programs for four other blue states: Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and Oregon. Why Is The Trump Administration Freezing Child Care Funds? The Trump administration’s decision to freeze $10 billion in funding for child care and social services in the five blue states, confirmed by the president on Monday, follows the recent discovery of a series of fraud schemes at Minnesota day care centers run by Somali residents. While news of the funding cuts broke on Monday, California officials said they had not received notice of them until a day later. In the letter sent by the ACF to Newsom, the division said it is ""concerned by the potential for extensive and systemic fraud in California Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) services that rely on federal funding.” The majority of the funds distributed by the CCDF across the country are used to provide child care services to families who meet certain income and need criteria. The same concern was raised for the state’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a program designed to help families with children experiencing low-income achieve economic security and stability. It mentioned the Minnesota case, adding that these concerns ""have been heightened by recent federal prosecutions and additional allegations that substantial portions of federal resources were fraudulently diverted away from the American families they were intended to assist.” While mentioning it ""has reason to believe” that fraud is being committed in the California child care system, the letter does not mention what this reason might be. According to the New York Post, HHS cited old reports of fraud involving some of these states in the past few years, including California, though many of these have already been prosecuted or charged. Newsom has brushed off the allegation, calling Trump ""a deranged, habitual liar whose relationship with reality ended years ago.” In an interview with MS NOW aired on Monday night, the governor said: ""Bring it on […] if he has some unique insight and information, I look forward to partnering with him. I can’t stand fraud.” What Does This Action Involve? As part of the Trump administration’s decision, the five affected states will see nearly $2.4 billion for CCDF frozen; $7.35 billion for TANF; and $869 million for the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), according to the Trump administration. ""Families who rely on child care and family assistance programs deserve confidence that these resources are used lawfully and for their intended purpose,” said Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill in a statement. ""This action reflects our commitment to program integrity, fiscal responsibility, and compliance with federal requirements.” ""We have a responsibility to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure these programs serve the families they were created to help,” said Assistant Secretary for Children and Families Alex J. Adams. ""When there are credible concerns about fraud or misuse, we will act.” In a post published on his social media platform Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that the ""Fraud Investigation of California has begun.” What’s At Stake In California? ACF said it will be conducting ""a thorough review” of California’s use of funding ""for compliance and alignment with statutory requirements.” The CCDF and TANF won’t be able to obtain any federal funding until it implements ""additional fiscal accountability requirements” proving it is not misusing money or delivering its services to children who are not eligible for its programs. California officials have stressed that the freezing of funding could have a negative impact on families relying on the programs, who could be forced to pay out-of-pocket. ""The California Department of Social Services administers child care programs that help working families afford safe, reliable care for their children—so parents can go to work, support their families, and contribute to their communities,” a representative of the California Department of Social Services told Newsweek . ""These funds are critical for working families across California. We take fraud seriously,” he added. H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the Department of Finance, told Governing.com that the current state budget includes $7.3 billion in child care spending, of which $2.2 billion is federal dollars. ""You want to support families? You believe in families? Then you believe in supporting child care and child care workers in the workforce,” Newsom said in his interview with MS NOW.

The January 9 edition of Objektiv , a Slovenian weekly magazine-style supplement published by the newspaper Dnevnik , features a portrait image of Trump with crude oil dripping over his top lips from below his nose. The positioning of the oil gives it the appearance of a mustache in the style Hitler was known for.  The cover includes the subhead ""American Attack on Venezuela."" Why It Matters Trump has faced comparisons to Hitler at several points during his time in office. Critics have often pointed to a parallel between his comments on nationalism, the media and immigration and authoritarian regimes like Nazi Germany.

newsweek,The Trump Administration is Making America Healthy Again | Opinion,America is in a chronic health crisis and must return to the basics of nutrition.,https://www.newsweek.com/the-trump-administration-is-making-america-healthy-again-opinion-11330028,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:46:02 -0500",2026-01-08 10:46:02-05:00,"America is in the middle of the worst chronic health crisis in our nation’s history, but the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for revitalization—which is rooted in the real, nutritious food grown by our farmers and ranchers. Every five years, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) are required by law to jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public. This report, known as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, is meant to provide science-based advice on what to eat and drink to promote health, reduce risk of chronic disease, and meet nutrient needs. However, since the very first report was published in 1980, our nation’s diet-related chronic disease rates have risen to pervasive levels. The CDC reports that over 40 percent of the roughly 73 million children (birth–17) in the United States have at least one chronic health condition, and three-quarters are not eligible for military service due to their health. These numbers are unacceptable. Poor health inhibits the ability of our citizens to live healthy and happy lives, especially when harmful habits are ingrained from childhood. By amending the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2025–2030, President Donald J. Trump is putting the well-being of Americans first—where it should have been all along. After decades of misguided nutritional advice, he is also delivering on his promise to reorient government based on common sense, science-backed policy. To Make America Healthy Again, we must return to the basics of nutrition. What we put into our bodies impacts what we can get out of them! What we eat impacts how we grow, function, and flourish. However, the American diet has shifted dramatically toward highly processed foods with artificial additives, which have displaced nutrient-dense whole foods grown by America’s farmers and ranchers. As a result, Americans are consuming fewer essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients needed for optimal biological functioning. The Trump administration is acutely aware of this danger, and we are doing something about it. At this decisive moment in our national history, the new Dietary Guidelines encourage American households to prioritize diets built on whole, nutrient-dense foods. The healthiest foods look the same coming out of the ground as they do on your plate, and we are blessed to live in a country with bountiful farmland where this should be achievable for all Americans, including our most vulnerable. Research consistently shows that key micronutrients such as calcium, iron, potassium, and vitamin D—which are found in fruits and vegetables—are essential for children’s physiological well-being. Evidence also consistently links diets centered on wholesome foods to lower rates of chronic diseases. That’s why we are finally putting real food back at the center of the American diet. Real food that nourishes the body, restores health, fuels energy, and builds strength. This pivot also supports the abundant healthy food being supplied by America’s incredible farmers and ranchers. By making milk, raising cattle, and growing wholesome fruits, vegetables, and grains, they hold the key to solving our national health crisis.

Related Podcasts Top Stories Trending     Opinion    ","The Trump Administration is Making America Healthy Again | Opinion America is in the middle of the worst chronic health crisis in our nation’s history, but the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for revitalization—which is rooted in the real, nutritious food grown by our farmers and ranchers. Every five years, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) are required by law to jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public. This report, known as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, is meant to provide science-based advice on what to eat and drink to promote health, reduce risk of chronic disease, and meet nutrient needs. However, since the very first report was published in 1980, our nation’s diet-related chronic disease rates have risen to pervasive levels. The CDC reports that over 40 percent of the roughly 73 million children (birth–17) in the United States have at least one chronic health condition, and three-quarters are not eligible for military service due to their health. These numbers are unacceptable. Poor health inhibits the ability of our citizens to live healthy and happy lives, especially when harmful habits are ingrained from childhood. By amending the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2025–2030, President Donald J. Trump is putting the well-being of Americans first—where it should have been all along. After decades of misguided nutritional advice, he is also delivering on his promise to reorient government based on common sense, science-backed policy. To Make America Healthy Again, we must return to the basics of nutrition. What we put into our bodies impacts what we can get out of them! What we eat impacts how we grow, function, and flourish. However, the American diet has shifted dramatically toward highly processed foods with artificial additives, which have displaced nutrient-dense whole foods grown by America’s farmers and ranchers. As a result, Americans are consuming fewer essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients needed for optimal biological functioning. The Trump administration is acutely aware of this danger, and we are doing something about it. At this decisive moment in our national history, the new Dietary Guidelines encourage American households to prioritize diets built on whole, nutrient-dense foods. The healthiest foods look the same coming out of the ground as they do on your plate, and we are blessed to live in a country with bountiful farmland where this should be achievable for all Americans, including our most vulnerable. Research consistently shows that key micronutrients such as calcium, iron, potassium, and vitamin D—which are found in fruits and vegetables—are essential for children’s physiological well-being. Evidence also consistently links diets centered on wholesome foods to lower rates of chronic diseases. That’s why we are finally putting real food back at the center of the American diet. Real food that nourishes the body, restores health, fuels energy, and builds strength. This pivot also supports the abundant healthy food being supplied by America’s incredible farmers and ranchers. By making milk, raising cattle, and growing wholesome fruits, vegetables, and grains, they hold the key to solving our national health crisis.

newsweek,Republicans Decry ‘Paramilitary ICE’ in Break With Trump,The GOP faces a test between reaffirming law-and-order credentials and responding to dissent over immigration enforcement.,https://www.newsweek.com/republican-paramilitary-ice-trump-11329481,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:40:04 -0500",2026-01-08 10:40:04-05:00,"Associate News Editor An anti-MAGA Republican group has publicly decried the White House’s “paramilitary” use of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) officers after a woman was fatally shot in Minnesota on Wednesday. Newsweek has contacted the White House via email for comment. Why It Matters The aggressive immigration enforcement of President Donald Trump's administration, including mass ICE raids and National Guard deployments in major American cities, has exposed a fissure within the Republican Party . What To Know Trump-critical Republican group The Reagan Caucus—historically supportive of U.S. foreign policy , but often at odds with the president on domestic and institutional issues—has denounced what it describes as the use of “paramilitary” tactics by federal agencies . This dissent highlights the risks of Trump alienating key constituencies in diverse metropolitan areas and battleground states as the GOP weighs its long-term coalition and electoral strategy . It comes after a woman, Renee Nicole Good , was fatally shot in Minneapolis by an ICE officer in the street in the Cedar‑Riverside neighborhood. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that Good had been “stalking and obstructing” officers throughout the day and allegedly attempted to use her vehicle as a weapon to run over an officer in what was described as an act of “domestic terrorism.” The Minneapolis City Council said in a statement that Good was “caring for her neighbors” when she was shot and killed. Mayor Jacob Frey accused the immigration agent involved of acting recklessly, calling the incident unacceptable. Meanwhile, protests erupted across the city , with demonstrators gathering near the scene to demand accountability and the removal of federal agents from Minneapolis. The Reagan Caucus—a conservative faction known for its foreign policy hawkishness and some past praise for White House actions such as support for democracy in Venezuela—echoed concerns about militarized ICE operations. It has previously criticized Trump on issues of law enforcement overreach while supporting certain other administration initiatives. For example, it responded to last weekend’s military operation in Venezuela by arguing that although “Trump should've done this by the book” and “Congress needed to be involved,” the decision not to was a “relatively small fault relative to the other ways recent presidents have abused executive discretion in foreign affairs.” The group added: “No president worth his salt would wait for U.N. approval on this matter. Venezuelans deserve better than that.” It also said that the prospect of the U.S. using military force to take control of Greenland was “insane,” but in another post, praised Trump’s “smart” move to demand a $500-billion increase to the war budget, from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion. The group wrote on X: “This is smart. Relative to GDP, our military spending is down from where it was in decades past, and China is as big a threat as we've ever faced.” Republican Opposition to ICE Enforcement Republican concern over the scope and conduct of Trump’s 2025 immigration enforcement policies has grown, with some GOP officials and conservative groups distancing themselves from the White House’s use of heavily armed ICE agents and military units. In North Carolina—a critical swing state—local Republicans and strategists have publicly worried that the administration’s mass ICE raids, which have resulted in the arrest of individuals without criminal records and viral images of heavily armed, masked agents, could undermine GOP traction with independent and Latino voters. “Republicans had the upper hand on immigration, as long as they were going after the criminals and the gangs, but I think they’re losing the upper hand on that issue because of the apparent disjointed implementation of arrest,” former GOP Governor Pat McCrory told Politico. “From a PR and political standpoint, for the first time, immigration is maybe having a negative impact on my party.” In Los Angeles last summer, County Supervisor Kathryn Barger—the city’s only elected Republican—emphasized the need for close cooperation and transparency among federal, state, and local authorities in response to the federal deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines amid unrest and protests over ICE raids. Barger said: “The deployment of National Guard troops is a significant action that must be approached with great care and coordination. While I understand the urgency that may prompt federal involvement, I believe any such deployment must be done in close partnership with state and local agencies to ensure the safety and well-being of our communities. “My focus remains on making sure that all efforts—federal, state, and local—are aligned to deliver real support where it’s needed most.” What People Are Saying Speaking to The New York Times on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said: “I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said: “The way they’re coming into cities, not just Minneapolis but around the country, is not OK.” Calling the ICE agent in Minnesota ’s actions self‑defense, Vice President JD Vance said: “The gaslighting is off the charts and I’m having none of it.” He added: “A tragedy? Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with.” Speaking about the raids leaving “a real sour aftertaste” with voters, Edwin Peacock III, a moderate Republican, told Politico : “Is the price of doing this worth it? I don’t see this cloud moving away [from] what will be in the voters’ minds.” What Happens Next The Trump administration remains resolute in its crackdown, with Department of Homeland Security officials reiterating their focus on removing “the worst of the worst.” Hearings on the scope and oversight of ICE operations have already been publicly demanded by members on both sides of the aisle, and with the 2026 midterm elections approaching, how Republicans address this rift could determine the party’s fortunes in diverse, populous urban centers and battleground states.

The U.S. seized two oil tankers with links to Venezuela on Wednesday, as the Trump administration keeps pressure on the Maduro loyalists who remain in charge, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio casts oil as a point of leverage . President Trump says he thinks the U.S. could oversee things in Venezuela for ""much longer"" than a year, telling The New York Times that ""only time will tell"" how long Washington will demand direct oversight of the country.

""I believe invoking the War Powers Act at this moment is necessary, given the President's comments about the possibility of 'boots on the ground' and a sustained engagement 'running' Venezuela, with which I do not agree,"" Collins continued.

The helicopter the pilot was flying — a heavy, twin-rotor MH-47 Chinook — was struck by hostile fire during the operation. Although it was damaged, it remained airborne and completed its run. The Chinook was the lead aircraft in a formation of U.S. Army helicopters tasked with inserting the assault team in the Maduro capture mission. They were carrying a force of Delta Force commandos as they slipped toward Caracas in the overnight operation — at first, largely unnoticed. As the aircraft drew closer to the heavily fortified compound where Maduro was believed to be holed up, the calm broke and Venezuelan defensive positions opened fire. U.S. helicopters responded with their own suppressive fire, according to the U.S. officials. A Pentagon official told CBS News on Tuesday that two U.S. service members were still recovering from injuries sustained during the incursion, which the Defense Department dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve. ""They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery,"" the Pentagon official said. ""Five additional service members suffered injuries but have already returned to duty. The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors.""

The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure of the Marinera, formerly known as Bella-1, after American forces began following the tanker in the Atlantic last month. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions. Two Defense Department officials told CBS News that Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that ""a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker"" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was ""conducting illicit activities."" A total of four sanctioned tankers have been seized in recent weeks, including two last month. The Marinera flew a Russian flag, and a Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the vessel was ""deemed stateless after flying a false flag."" She said it was part of a ""shadow fleet"" that transports oil in violation of sanctions.

Those purchases could include agricultural products, medicines, medical devices and equipment needed to fix the country's beleaguered electrical grid, Mr. Trump wrote. ""In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner – A wise choice, and a very good thing for the people of Venezuela, and the United States,"" the president continued. Since Maduro's capture, Mr. Trump has focused on Venezuela's oil industry , pressing U.S. companies to enter the country — a move he has suggested could help rebuild the oil-rich nation's crumbling infrastructure. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has argued that oil could serve as a point of leverage over the remnants of the Maduro regime who continue to run Venezuela. Earlier Wednesday, Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at ""market rates,"" with revenue used ""in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people."" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil. She added that the proceeds will be put in U.S.-controlled bank accounts and be ""dispersed for the benefit of the American people and the Venezuelan people at the discretion of the United States government."" It's not clear how much revenue will be drawn from the oil sales. Venezuelan crude oil, which is tough to refine and has historically faced tight U.S. sanctions, has been sold at a discount in the past, though some refineries on the U.S.'s Gulf Coast are set up to process the kind of heavy crude oil that typically flows from Venezuela, according to Reuters. https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/venezuela-maduro-trump-oil-senate-war-powers/#post-update-614acd21 link copied Actions in Venezuela divide Americans as they look for clarity on Trump admin. goals, CBS News poll finds The U.S. military action removing Nicolás Maduro from power divides Americans, and their views on it connect to what they think the U.S. goals are and what they believe comes next. Some 48% of U.S. adults approve of the operation and 52% disapprove, according to a CBS News poll taken between Monday and Wednesday. The margin of error is 2.4 points. At the moment, most think the Trump administration is among other aims trying to get access to Venezuela's oil and expand U.S. power in the region — and when Americans think those are big parts of the goals, they tend to disapprove. When people think the goals are a lot about stopping drugs, gangs and terrorists, they are more approving.  That view is largely voiced by Republicans.

The helicopter the pilot was flying — a heavy, twin-rotor MH-47 Chinook — was struck by hostile fire during the operation. Although it was damaged, it remained airborne and completed its run. The Chinook was the lead aircraft in a formation of U.S. Army helicopters tasked with inserting the assault team in the Maduro capture mission. They were carrying a force of Delta Force commandos as they slipped toward Caracas in the overnight operation — at first, largely unnoticed. As the aircraft drew closer to the heavily fortified compound where Maduro was believed to be holed up, the calm broke and Venezuelan defensive positions opened fire. U.S. helicopters responded with their own suppressive fire, according to the U.S. officials. A Pentagon official told CBS News on Tuesday that two U.S. service members were still recovering from injuries sustained during the incursion, which the Defense Department dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve. ""They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery,"" the Pentagon official said. ""Five additional service members suffered injuries but have already returned to duty.

President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies — and Greenland — vehemently disagree with. But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources. Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory: ""It's so strategic right now"" Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government. Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes — especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base. Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. ""It's so strategic right now,"" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. ""Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it."" ""The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,"" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year. Control over a new, valuable route for shipping Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route — allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months. A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.

Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, ""have only been lightly explored and developed,"" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024. Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies. Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted. Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said. China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.

The third vote comes days after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-war-powers-vote-trump-venezuela-maduro/,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:06:51 -0500",2026-01-08 11:06:51-05:00,"Updated on:  January 8, 2026 / 11:06 AM EST / CBS News Washington — The Senate is voting for the third time Thursday on a powers resolution that would limit President Trump's ability to strike Venezuela as the U.S. leader continues to take unilateral action against the South American country. The vote comes days after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a nighttime raid that came not only as a surprise to the former president, but also to Congress. Mr. Trump had long teased land strikes against Venezuela amid a monthslong military campaign against alleged drug-smuggling boats at sea that has killed more than 100 people. Mr. Trump has not ruled out additional military action. He has said that the U.S. will ""run"" the country for the time being and control its oil sales after Saturday's strikes, which were carried out as part of a daring operation to capture Maduro and bring him to the U.S. to face charges. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, introduced his latest resolution in early December, after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea. Kaine's measure would require ""the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress."" ""The indication from the administration [is] that this is not a few days or a few weeks, it's likely a few years of U.S. occupation and involvement in this country,"" Kaine said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""This is not an arrest warrant. This is far bigger than that."" Without additional Republican support, the measure is expected to meet the same fate as the previous failed two efforts spearheaded by Kaine to restrict military action in the region. Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, held briefings for top lawmakers on Tuesday on last weekend's actions in the region. They held similar briefings for all members of Congress on Wednesday. Democrats left those briefings dissatisfied with the answers they received about what comes next. The boat strikes and Maduro's seizure and removal to the U.S. have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers, with some accusing the Trump administration of committing war crimes, lying about its intentions for regime change and leading the U.S. into a war without congressional authorization. ""I think bombing a capital and removing the head of state is by all definitions, war,"" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the lone Republican cosponsor of the resolution, said Tuesday. Members of the Trump administration, including the president, have muddied the legal arguments by claiming that the operation to capture Maduro was a ""law enforcement"" operation that didn't require sign-off from Congress. Mr. Trump and other officials also say the U.S. is now in charge of Venezuela. Many Republicans have defended the Trump administration's failure to seek approval from Congress, arguing the actions are well within the president's constitutional authority and limited in scope. ""This is not a regime change. This is demand for change of behavior by a regime,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said after Monday's classified briefing. ""We don't expect troops on the ground."" Johnson added Wednesday, ""The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. There's no dispute about that, of course, but we are not in a war in Venezuela."" Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho called the resolution ""nonsense,"" and said ""the effect of this is to slap the president of the United States in the face."" ""That is the only effect that this vote can have. It can have no practical effect, because it's trying to stop something that isn't going on,"" Risch added. Boat strikes scrutinized In the weeks before Maduro's capture, Mr. Trump dialed up his pressure campaign, seizing two sanctioned tankers that were carrying oil from Venezuela. On Wednesday, the U.S. carried out operations to seize two more vessels linked to Venezuela. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has voted against the war powers resolutions, suggested that if the U.S. can seize a giant oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, it could also seize smaller boats allegedly carrying drugs. ""I would take note, if we can take a big ship like this, we may be able to take a few boats, too, without blowing them out of the water,"" he told reporters last month. ""But that's a decision they have to make on the ground, I guess, based on the threat level."" Paul, who has been a fierce critic of the strikes and has decried the lack of due process, shared a letter he received from the U.S. Coast Guard that said dozens of suspected drug smuggling vessels interdicted by the military branch possessed no illegal drugs. In total, 212 interdictions occurred between Sept. 1, 2024, and Oct. 7, 2025, according to the letter. Of those, 41 boats had ""no illicit contraband on board when interdicted,"" according to the Coast Guard. The letter also provided details on interceptions in the Caribbean Sea. ""Of the 212 total vessels interdicted during this period, 69 vessels were interdicted in the Caribbean Sea by Coast Guard surface assets, operating under Coast Guard law enforcement authority,"" the letter continued. ""Of these 69 interdictions, 14 had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted; 11 of those 14 vessels without contraband did not appear to commit any federal criminal offense. Of the 69 Caribbean interdictions, 14 vessels were indicted off the coast of Venezuela. Three of the 14 vessels interdicted near Venezuela had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted, but one of the three violated other U.S. federal criminal statutes."" To justify the strikes, the Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an ""armed attack"" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House. But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. Lawmakers critical of the military action argue the rationale in the opinion is inadequate for the situation and have demanded that it be made public. In December, Mr. Trump signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a ""weapon of mass destruction,"" perhaps seeking to bolster the justification for military action around Venezuela. Fentanyl was not mentioned in the indictment against Maduro. Kaia  Hubbard , Grace  Kazarian and Ibrahim  Aksoy contributed to this report.

cbs_world,"Pope Leo asks cardinals to help him ""point the way for our path ahead""","Pope Leo XIV, the Catholic Church's first ever American leader, appears to signal a more inclusive leadership style than his predecessor.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-leo-xiv-catholic-church-extraordinary-consistory-cardinals-input-after-francis/,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:06:59 -0500",2026-01-08 10:06:59-05:00,"January 8, 2026 / 10:06 AM EST / CBS News Rome — Pope Leo XIV has summoned Catholic cardinals from around the world to the Vatican for a meeting called an ""extraordinary consistory,"" to seek their guidance on the Catholic Church's priorities for the years ahead. ""I am here to listen,"" Leo, a Chicago native and the first ever pope from the U.S., said Wednesday in his opening remarks. ""This day-and-a-half together will point the way for our path ahead."" Of the 245 members of the College of Cardinals, 170 of the so-called ""princes of the church"" were in Vatican City to participate in the gathering. As it got underway, Leo asked the cardinals to select two of four possible topics for detailed discussions: The missionary nature of the church, further reforms of the Vatican bureaucracy, synodality and liturgy. A majority chose to prioritize the missionary and synodal themes over the liturgy or Vatican reforms, according to Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni. That means the consistory is likely to focus on how to make the church more missionary, and more responsive to the needs of the faithful. Significantly, the cardinals chose not to discuss liturgy, which would likely have seen them grapple with divisions within the church over the celebration of the traditional Latin Mass, which became a flashpoint after Pope Francis significantly restricted its use. The Latin Mass —   also known as the Tridentine mass — is controversial because it represents a form of Catholic worship that some say is out of touch with modern sensibilities. It is celebrated entirely in Latin, with the priest facing the altar and the faithful receiving communion on the tongue while kneeling. Critics argue that it can feel inaccessible and limits parishioners' participation, while supporters say it is a sacred preservation of tradition. Merely by convening the consistory, Pope Leo's has underscored his commitment to involving the full College of Cardinals in governance of the Catholic Church, which has some 1.4 billion followers worldwide according to the Vatican. By contrast, during his 12-year papacy, Pope Francis held only one extraordinary consistory, instead relying primarily on a small group of hand-picked advisors to help him plot the church's course — a practice that left some cardinals feeling sidelined. Since his election at the papal conclave in May , the American pontiff's tenure has largely been shaped by commitments inherited from Francis, including the major events of the 2025 Holy Year . By convening the consistory immediately after those Holy Year events, Leo appears to be signaling the unofficial launch of his own pontificate, and charting a course aligned with his priorities. Leo signalled on Wednesday that his papacy would be progressive, calling the Second Vatican Council — a landmark gathering in the 1960s known as Vatican II that was seen as a significant move to modernize the Catholic Church —   the ""guiding star"" of the Church's journey under his leadership. Among other things, Vatican II allowed for mass to be celebrated in local languages, not just the traditional Latin. It also introduced simpler rites and encouraged more participation by active lay people in congregations, and cemented improved relations between Catholics, Jews and people of other faiths, and promoting the church's engagement with the modern world.

Whether a significant number of people answer his call could determine whether deadly, 12-day-old protests fizzle out as previous rounds of unrest have, or grow into a major challenge to the government, and provoke a possible wider crackdown. ""My dear compatriots, over the last week I have watched your demonstrations closely, particularly those that are taking place today in the bazaars of Tehran,"" Pahlavi said in a video posted Tuesday on social media. ""Despite the regime's ongoing violent crackdown , you are resisting, and it is inspiring,"" Pahlavi said. ""You have certainly noticed and seen that larger crowds have repeatedly led regime forces to flee and have even increased defections to the side of the people. Therefore, it is critical to keep these demonstrations disciplined, and as large as possible. This Thursday and Friday, January 8th and 9th, starting precisely at 8 pm, wherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time. Based on your response, I will announce the next calls to action."" Some analysts and Iranian insiders believe it could be a crucial moment. ""It seems as though his call for people to come out in masses today and tomorrow could be a turning point,"" Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told CBS News on Thursday. ""This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force. But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch."" Another longtime observer of the regime inside the country, referring to Pahlavi's call, said in written comments to CBS News on Thursday that, ""the moment we're all waiting for is 8pm this evening ... If there is widespread participation — impossible to ignore —   it could be a turning point."" ""If the chanting at 8 o'clock is really loud —   ear-deafening, and in chorus, and eye-catching [ie impossible for authorities to ignore], then from Friday on it will be assumed the protests are a real force and they will gain momentum —   and then we are heading for the unknown,"" they said.

""In 2022, the regime could respond more directly to the demands of the protesters by simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth,"" Yacoubian said. ""There was a lot of violence that was undertaken. Many people were killed. But you actually have seen a very significant relaxing of those kinds of social strictures in Iran."" Despite that relaxation of some rules governing people's daily behavior, the intense economic woes in sanctions-wracked Iran was enough to spark the current wave of unrest, which, despite a number of measures aimed at placating demonstrators, has continued to spread around the country. Yacoubian said the Iranian government did not have any meaningful way to assuage the concerns of the current demonstrators over Iran's economy. ""In the case of these economically driven protests, there's really nothing (the regime) can do to address the concerns and the kind of the drivers of public disaffection, because it's driven by an economy that has utterly failed and is collapsing,"" Yacoubian said. Another potential factor is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's potential interest in further targeting Iran's ballistic missile program at a moment of perceived weakness for the regime in Tehran. ""That's a completely different dynamic that has nothing to do with these protests, but that actually, frankly, even if there had been no protests and you were asking me, I'd say, look, I think it's very possible that we're going to see a second round of conflict between Israel and Iran,"" Yacoubian said. Iran's leaders, ""certainly have, I'm sure, a very clear understanding of all the pressure points, both domestic and foreign, and it could be that's why they're so off their footing, is they actually are reading, probably well, the situation and don't really seem to have a good plan as to how to manage the unrest.""

Iran's leaders, ""certainly have, I'm sure, a very clear understanding of all the pressure points, both domestic and foreign, and it could be that's why they're so off their footing, is they actually are reading, probably well, the situation and don't really seem to have a good plan as to how to manage the unrest.""

Forty people, most of them teenagers, were killed, and 116 were injured. The pair, who are facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, will be questioned by the public prosecutor's office in the nearby town of Sion, a source close to the investigation, who asked not to be named, told AFP on Thursday.

Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday. The oldest Homo sapien fossils , dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh. Our cousins the Neanderthals mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia. This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches? This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago. Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain. They belonged to a species dubbed ""Homo antecessor,"" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins. This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there. There was ""a gap in the fossil record of Africa,"" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP. The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca. Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers. Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported . ""Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,"" Hublin told Reuters. ""However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores."" A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing. ""Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,"" Hublin said. ""We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be."" However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short. When Earth's magnetic field flipped Then the researchers tried a different approach. Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole. Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world. The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a ""very, very precise"" date, Hublin said. This discovery eliminates the ""absence of plausible ancestors"" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added. Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds ""weight to the increasingly prevalent idea"" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa. ""This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,"" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature. Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins. But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of ""populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating."" The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar. So the Casablanca fossils are ""another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges"" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said. The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.

As violent demonstrations popped up in more cities and towns across the Islamic Republic, the regime took a familiar stance, leaning into anti-Western rhetoric, ignoring the reports of dozens of civilians being killed, and offering economic aid to residents in a bid to quell the unrest that started as protests over inflation and the cost of living. As they grapple for ways to end the street protests — under the threat of U.S. intervention by President Trump — Iranian authorities said a man was executed by hanging after being convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, according to the country's state-run IRNA news agency. Ali Ardestani was convicted of providing Israeli intelligence ""with images and photos of specific locations and information on target subjects, and received amounts in the form of digital currency at the end of each mission,"" IRNA said. Iranian authorities hold trials behind closed doors, and no evidence against Ardestani was made public. Iran executed more than 1,000 people last year— the highest number of executions in the country since 1989, according to Amnesty International. The latest execution came as Iran 's hardline Islamic rulers face the most significant domestic unrest seen in the country in several years. Nationwide protests against the autocratic regime entered their 12th day on Thursday. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency ( HRANA ), set up by Iranian human rights activists and reliant on a network of contacts still in the country, said Wednesday that at least 38 people had been killed since the protests began, including four security forces. The protests started as business owners in Tehran vented frustration over spiraling inflation and the cost of basic goods. Iran's economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years, but the demonstrations escalated quickly into the widest protests seen in the country since 2022, following the death of a young woman in police custody after she was detained for an alleged dress code violation. Trump's warning lingers as Iran tries to quell protests On Sunday, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. could hit Iran ""very hard"" if protesters are not protected. ""We're watching it very closely,"" Mr. Trump said. He'd said two days earlier that if Iran ""violently kills protesters,"" the U.S. would ""come to their rescue."" So far, there's been no overt sign of the U.S. following through on these threats, even as the reported death toll from the protests climbs, and no further comment from the White House about what actions by the Iranian regime might actually trigger a response. In an effort to quell the internal pressure, Iran's government announced economic measures over the weekend to help Iranian citizens make ends meet, and state media said Wednesday that President Mahsoud Pezeshkian had ordered security forces not to attack peaceful demonstrators. Iran offers food aid in a bid to calm the streets Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said the new assistance measures, among other things, would triple national subsidies for regular households to buy basic goods, according to the state-controlled Mehr News Agency. The primary benefit, expected to begin Wednesday, would effectively triple the amount Iranians are given by the government to buy basic food items, adding the equivalent of about $7 more per month on top of existing subsidies for food, based on current exchange rates. One Iranian told CBS News on Wednesday that the subsidy increase wouldn't be enough. ""If two people in a family want to have eggs, bread, and cheese for their breakfast, the subsidy is spent on the first day,"" said the Tehran resident, who declined to be named. New Iran army chief hurls new threats at the West As it often does during moments of domestic unrest, Tehran has continued to take a hard line, publicly, against its two biggest adversaries, Israel and the U.S. In a statement Wednesday, addressing students at Iran's Army Command and Staff University in Tehran, Iran's new overall army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened to ""cut off the hand of any aggressor.""

An update shortly before midnight said the agency was exploring ""all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew 11's mission."" ""These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,"" the update said. ""We will provide further updates within the next 24 hours."" While NASA did not identify the astronaut in question or explain the medical issue — standard practice due to privacy concerns — the agency said ""the matter involved a single crew member who is stable."" Space station commander Mike Fincke, flight engineer Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov launched to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship on August. 1. Going into the new year, the crew expected to remain in space until their replacements arrive in mid-February. Crew 11's return to Earth is expected around Feb. 20. That's still the official plan. In the meantime, Cardman, 38, and Fincke, 58, a veteran of nine spacewalks on earlier missions, were planning to venture outside the station Thursday to finish building a truss needed to support a set of roll-out solar arrays and to carry out other planned maintenance. A second spacewalk by two yet-to-be-announced astronauts was planned for next week. But NASA called off the the first spacewalk earlier Wednesday, saying ""the agency is monitoring a medical concern with a crew member that arose Wednesday afternoon. Due to medical privacy, it is not appropriate for NASA to share more details about the crew member."" ""The situation is stable. NASA will share additional details, including a new date for the upcoming spacewalk, later.""

See earlier developments below. What to know about U.S. actions and Venezuela's future The U.S. seized a Venezuela-linked sanctioned oil tanker in the North Atlantic and a tanker in the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday — the latest seizures since beginning the campaign against Venezuela in early September. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after a Trump administration briefing for senators that the U.S. has ""tremendous leverage"" over Venezuela and will control the proceeds from the sale of millions of barrels of oil to help stabilize the country. Democrats are pushing for a vote this week to limit future military action in the South American country, after a surprise U.S. operation led to the capture of its now former president, Nicolás Maduro , who is in a Brooklyn jail cell awaiting trial. Mr. Trump's sights remain set on Greenland, with the White House saying it's open to a ""range of options"" for the U.S. to take over the Arctic island, including military force — part of an expansionist strategy the president has called the ""Don-roe Doctrine."" Venezuela's interior minister says 100 were killed during U.S. operation, including civilians Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Wednesday that 100 people were killed during the U.S. operation, but he didn't offer details on how many were civilians or members of the military. ""So far, there are one hundred dead. One hundred,"" he said. ""And a similar number of injured. The attack against the country is terrible. No one will be able to conceal it up. There's no way this can be concealed. And the world is discovering it in its entirety. ""People who had nothing to do with the conflict died. Civilians. Women who were in their homes. People who were in their homes. They were hit by the impact of the bombs, the incredibly powerful bombs that were dropped on our country."" https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/venezuela-maduro-capture-president-trump-senate-oil/#post-update-606ce2aa link copied Actions in Venezuela divide Americans as they look for clarity on Trump admin. goals, CBS News poll finds The U.S. military action removing Nicolás Maduro from power divides Americans, and their views on it connect to what they think the U.S. goals are and what they believe comes next. Some 48% of U.S. adults approve of the operation and 52% disapprove, according to a CBS News poll taken between Monday and Wednesday. The margin of error is 2.4 points. At the moment, most think the Trump administration is among other aims trying to get access to Venezuela's oil and expand U.S. power in the region — and when Americans think those are big parts of the goals, they tend to disapprove. When people think the goals are a lot about stopping drugs, gangs and terrorists, they are more approving. That view is largely voiced by Republicans. Either way, that mix of perceptions is partly because most Americans say the administration hasn't clearly explained the U.S.' plans with Venezuela.

Those purchases could include agricultural products, medicines, medical devices and equipment needed to fix the country's beleaguered electrical grid, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner – A wise choice, and a very good thing for the people of Venezuela, and the United States,"" the president continued. Earlier Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at ""market rates,"" with revenue used ""in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people."" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil. She added that the proceeds will be put in U.S.-controlled bank accounts and be ""dispersed for the benefit of the American people and the Venezuelan people at the discretion of the United States government."" It's not clear how much revenue will be drawn from the oil sales. Venezuelan crude oil, which is tough to refine and has historically faced tight U.S. sanctions, has been sold at a discount in the past, though some refineries on the U.S.'s Gulf Coast are set up to process the kind of heavy crude oil that typically flows from Venezuela, according to Reuters. https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/venezuela-maduro-capture-president-trump-senate-oil/#post-update-d184190a link copied House Democrats raise further concerns about Venezuela House Democrats continued to question the Trump administration's plans for Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, told CBS News' Nikole Killion, ""In terms of what comes next, it does not seem that this administration seems to be forthright, transparent, or frankly, have communicated the thought necessary."" She said the answers to many questions in the House briefing were ""simple,"" but noted, ""but when we dig into the details, and when we are talking about not just oil, when we're talking about taking over an entire other nation's economy, when our own economy is floundering here in the United States, that sure seems to be like a tremendous responsibility."" She said the administration had ""lost sight of"" the economic issues facing Americans, ""And now we're talking about taking over an entire other country's economy without basic answers to some of the most, again, basic economic questions that were posed by members."" Rep. Adam Smith, of Washington, also told CBS News the briefing was light on the administration's plans on what comes next, noting the danger that Venezuela could slide into further instability. He urged Pentagon and administration officials to publicly testify and be transparent with the American public. https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/venezuela-maduro-capture-president-trump-senate-oil/#post-update-35407e1d link copied Venezuela's ambassador condemns ""kidnapping"" of Maduro at U.N.

Moncada also denounced the ""kidnapping"" of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, adding that he ""regretted that the U.N. had not played a more active role in condemning the threat and use of force by the government of the United States of America against Venezuelan territorial integrity and political independence.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after a Trump administration briefing for senators that the U.S. has ""tremendous leverage"" over Venezuela and will control the proceeds from the sale of millions of barrels of oil to help stabilize the country. Democrats are pushing for a vote this week to limit future military action in the South American country, after a surprise U.S. operation led to the capture of its now former president, Nicolás Maduro , who is in a Brooklyn jail cell awaiting trial. Mr. Trump's sights remain set on Greenland, with the White House saying it's open to a ""range of options"" for the U.S. to take over the Arctic island, including military force — part of an expansionist strategy the president has called the ""Don-roe Doctrine."" Venezuela's interior minister says 100 were killed during U.S. operation, including civilians Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Wednesday that 100 people were killed during the U.S. operation, but he didn't offer details on how many were civilians or members of the military. ""So far, there are one hundred dead. One hundred,"" he said. ""And a similar number of injured. The attack against the country is terrible. No one will be able to conceal it up. There's no way this can be concealed. And the world is discovering it in its entirety. ""People who had nothing to do with the conflict died. Civilians. Women who were in their homes.

Some 48% of U.S. adults approve of the operation and 52% disapprove, according to a CBS News poll taken between Monday and Wednesday. The margin of error is 2.4 points. At the moment, most think the Trump administration is among other aims trying to get access to Venezuela's oil and expand U.S. power in the region — and when Americans think those are big parts of the goals, they tend to disapprove. When people think the goals are a lot about stopping drugs, gangs and terrorists, they are more approving. That view is largely voiced by Republicans. Either way, that mix of perceptions is partly because most Americans say the administration hasn't clearly explained the U.S.' plans with Venezuela.

Machado spoke with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil in a network exclusive Tuesday, saying, ""We are ready and willing to serve our people, as we have been mandated."" The former legislator won a primary race to run against Maduro in Venezuela's 2024 presidential election. The government then banned her from running, but retired diplomat Edmundo González stepped in as a replacement. The U.S. and other governments recognized González as the winner after the Maduro government was accused of rigging the vote tallies. Machado also called interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who remains in control of Venezuela, ""one of the main architects"" of Maduro's oppressive regime. ""Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,"" she told Dokoupil. https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/venezuela-maduro-capture-president-trump-senate-oil/#post-update-d759aa41 link copied Venezuelan authorities to give U.S. at least 30 million barrels of oil, Trump says Venezuelan authorities have agreed to give the U.S. between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil, President Trump said in a social media post Tuesday evening. ""I am pleased to announce that the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright would organize the process of transferring oil from Venezuela to the U.S., the president said. He didn't offer further details about where the oil would be coming from or who exactly authorized the transfer. The Venezuelan government didn't appear to respond to the president's post. Mr. Trump said the oil will be taken by storage ships and ""brought directly to unloading docks"" in the U.S. The president has pushed for increased oil production in Venezuela, encouraging U.S. firms to invest in the country. Some experts have predicted that it could take a while for foreign oil companies to enter Venezuela, considering the high cost and political uncertainty. https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/venezuela-maduro-capture-president-trump-senate-oil/#post-update-c78dd9e3 link copied White House discussing ""range of options"" for acquiring Greenland, Leavitt says The White House said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force. Senior administration officials are also discussing possibly acquiring Greenland from Denmark or forming a compact of free association, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Reuters was first to report these developments. ""President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it's vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,"" Leavitt said. ""The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander in chief's disposal."" President Trump has made clear for months that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, citing its strategic location. The leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have strongly objected to the idea of the U.S. taking over the island.

The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure of the Marinera, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker formerly known as Bella-1. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions and pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro. Two Defense Department officials told CBS News Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. They were flown by service members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the ""Night Stalkers."" The U.S. has been following the tanker since last month, and CBS News first reported on Monday that American forces were planning to intercept it. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month. U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that ""a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker"" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X that the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was ""conducting illicit activities"" and operating in international waters. Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Sophia was flying a Cameroonian flag and left Venezuela with oil on board. The U.S. judged the ship to be in violation of its embargo on Venezuela. The officials said the U.S. has full control of the vessel and no U.S. personnel were injured in the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard was escorting the vessel to the U.S. ""for final disposition,"" according to U.S. Southern Command. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, who posted video of one of the interceptions on social media, described the operations as ""back-to-back"" and ""meticulously coordinated,"" adding that the vessels were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it. The Marinera, formerly Bella-1 The Marinera — which has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department — was sailing under the Russian flag. It was previously flagged out of Panama. Like other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading. A Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday. Noem said the tanker ""has been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice."" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the tanker a Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel. ""The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,"" she said. Russia responded to the seizure, with its Ministry of Transport saying on the messaging platform Telegram Wednesday that the vessel had been ""granted temporary permission to sail under the State Flag of the Russian Federation, issued in accordance with Russian legislation and the norms of international law,"" ""In accordance with the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,"" the ministry said. The ministry said that U.S. naval forces boarded the Marinera at 3 p.m. Moscow time Wednesday and that communication with the ship was later lost. The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping lists the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times reported that the Russian government officially had asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship. The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said earlier this week that the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and that the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper , a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela. Ships like the Marinera and The Skipper are part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela. Maduro has rejected U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and accuses the U.S. of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement.

cbs_world,CBS News poll finds actions in Venezuela divide Americans,"Most don't want the U.S. to control Venezuela. Maduro's removal from power draws big backing from MAGA, Republicans.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-actions-venezuela-opinion-poll/,"Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:03:00 -0500",2026-01-07 17:03:00-05:00,"January 7, 2026 / 5:03 PM EST / CBS News The U.S. military action removing Nicolás Maduro from power divides Americans, and their views on it connect to what they think the U.S. goals are and what they believe comes next. At the moment, most think the Trump administration is among other aims trying to get access to Venezuela's oil and expand U.S. power in the region — and when Americans think those are big parts of the goals, they tend to disapprove. When people think the goals are a lot about stopping drugs , gangs and terrorists, they are more approving.  That view is largely voiced by Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who think this action will make the U.S. stronger, and they give the operation overwhelming support. Either way, that mix of perceptions is partly because most Americans say the administration hasn't clearly explained the U.S.' plans with Venezuela. Looking ahead, the public expresses uncertainty about what happens now with the U.S. military and Venezuela. Those who think U.S. military involvement will be limited are more approving of the action than those who now foresee a lot of involvement. And the majority do not want to see the U.S. having a lot of control over Venezuela . MAGA's views on Venezuela operation Even more MAGA Republicans support the action now than supported the idea of it back in November. There are at least two reasons: one is that they overwhelmingly call the operation a military success, whereas other Americans frequently say it's too soon to evaluate. Another is that they see more impact: MAGA Republicans are especially apt to say this will stop drugs, make the U.S. position in the world stronger, and get other countries in the region to cooperate with the U.S. Other Americans, by contrast, are more mixed on those implications. For context, MAGA Republicans also overwhelmingly approved of the U.S. bombing in Iran last summer. Impact of Maduro's removal from power on U.S. standing U.S. military and involvement from here On balance, many more call the specific operation that removed Maduro a success than not, but nearly half feel it is too soon to say. That may depend on what they think happens from here. Very few want the U.S. to have a lot of control over Venezuela now. Most do not support further military action if Venezuela does not cooperate with U.S. interests. Nor would they back taking military action in other countries in the region if those countries are not seen as cooperating with the U.S. But Republicans stand apart here — particularly most of the MAGA base: Most would support further military actions in either of those cases. In the region President Trump Somewhat more people approve of the military action to remove Maduro than approve of the president's handling of the situation with Venezuela more generally; the latter tracks more closely to his overall approval, and his overall approval hasn't changed since before this action. While they still don't give it wide approval, some groups do rate Maduro's removal a little more highly compared to how they rate the president's job performance overall. Hispanics are divided about the action to remove Maduro in the same split as Americans overall. Slightly more independents approve of removing Maduro than approve of Trump overall. Congress' role Looking at the role of Congress: just as before the action, when most Americans said Mr. Trump needed congressional approval for military action in Venezuela, so today do most Americans think Congress would need to approve any further military action there. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,325 U.S. adults interviewed between January 5-7, 2026. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

All Rights Reserved.","CBS News poll finds actions in Venezuela divide Americans January 7, 2026 / 5:03 PM EST / CBS News The U.S. military action removing Nicolás Maduro from power divides Americans, and their views on it connect to what they think the U.S. goals are and what they believe comes next. At the moment, most think the Trump administration is among other aims trying to get access to Venezuela's oil and expand U.S. power in the region — and when Americans think those are big parts of the goals, they tend to disapprove. When people think the goals are a lot about stopping drugs , gangs and terrorists, they are more approving.  That view is largely voiced by Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who think this action will make the U.S. stronger, and they give the operation overwhelming support. Either way, that mix of perceptions is partly because most Americans say the administration hasn't clearly explained the U.S.' plans with Venezuela. Looking ahead, the public expresses uncertainty about what happens now with the U.S. military and Venezuela. Those who think U.S. military involvement will be limited are more approving of the action than those who now foresee a lot of involvement. And the majority do not want to see the U.S. having a lot of control over Venezuela . MAGA's views on Venezuela operation Even more MAGA Republicans support the action now than supported the idea of it back in November. There are at least two reasons: one is that they overwhelmingly call the operation a military success, whereas other Americans frequently say it's too soon to evaluate. Another is that they see more impact: MAGA Republicans are especially apt to say this will stop drugs, make the U.S. position in the world stronger, and get other countries in the region to cooperate with the U.S. Other Americans, by contrast, are more mixed on those implications. For context, MAGA Republicans also overwhelmingly approved of the U.S. bombing in Iran last summer. Impact of Maduro's removal from power on U.S. standing U.S. military and involvement from here On balance, many more call the specific operation that removed Maduro a success than not, but nearly half feel it is too soon to say. That may depend on what they think happens from here. Very few want the U.S. to have a lot of control over Venezuela now. Most do not support further military action if Venezuela does not cooperate with U.S. interests. Nor would they back taking military action in other countries in the region if those countries are not seen as cooperating with the U.S. But Republicans stand apart here — particularly most of the MAGA base: Most would support further military actions in either of those cases. In the region President Trump Somewhat more people approve of the military action to remove Maduro than approve of the president's handling of the situation with Venezuela more generally; the latter tracks more closely to his overall approval, and his overall approval hasn't changed since before this action. While they still don't give it wide approval, some groups do rate Maduro's removal a little more highly compared to how they rate the president's job performance overall. Hispanics are divided about the action to remove Maduro in the same split as Americans overall. Slightly more independents approve of removing Maduro than approve of Trump overall. Congress' role Looking at the role of Congress: just as before the action, when most Americans said Mr. Trump needed congressional approval for military action in Venezuela, so today do most Americans think Congress would need to approve any further military action there. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,325 U.S. adults interviewed between January 5-7, 2026. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

The U.S. seeking control of Greenland, ""to get the strategic minerals is also a bit strange, given that nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time."" As for U.S. defense interests in Greenland, which President Trump has always stressed as a primary driver of his desire to control the island, Brask told CBS News there have been few hurdles to deepening such ties in the past, and very few at present.

""It's not you running the country, but you have the options, the possibility of having troops, material … equipment in Greenland, you just have to ask."" The U.S. has maintained one military base in Greenland, the Pituffik Space Base, which supports important missile warning and defense systems, and is the site of radar and satellite surveillance systems.

The Iranian government is trying to quell the unrest, and reacted angrily to President Trump's veiled threat of a U.S. armed intervention . The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which gave the death toll based on its network of contacts in the country, said in its daily report on Tuesday that at least 36 people ""have been confirmed killed during the past ten days of protests. Among them were four individuals under the age of 18, as well as two members of security and law enforcement forces."" HRANA said more than 2,000 protesters had been arrested, ""however, the actual number of detainees is estimated to be significantly higher."" The organization shared video on Tuesday that it said showed clashes between protesters and security forces at Tehran's Grand Bazaar — a center of commerce in the capital where shop owners have long backed the regime. The protests began more than a week ago in Tehran as business owners took to the streets to vent their frustration over soaring inflation in the nation, whose economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years. But the anger spread quickly to more than 250 locations in at least 27 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the Washington-based HRANA, with social media videos showing violent clashes between protesters chanting anti-government slogans and security forces every night since. People who spoke with CBS News from inside the country on Tuesday said the latest demonstrations in the capital were relatively small, corroborating other reports that efforts by the Iranian authorities to placate the protesters have likely had some effect in reducing numbers in recent days. President Trump said Friday — a day before American forces attacked Venezuela and captured the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro — that the U.S. was ""locked and loaded and ready,"" warning that if Iran ""violently kills protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue."" Mr. Trump hasn't offered any further detail on his threat, but he's been ratcheting up pressure on Tehran since taking office for his second term, including with unprecedented U.S. strikes on the country's nuclear facilities in June as Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war. ""I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that,"" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent Iranian news website IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday, referring to Mr. Trump's remarks. ""The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people."" Iranian officials have not confirmed the deaths of any protesters, and while acknowledging the demonstrations and economic pain felt in the country, they make little mention of the violence seen on the streets and accuse the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the unrest. The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency claimed Monday that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest. The U.S. State Department has issued statements condemning specific incidents in Iran since Mr. Trump leveled his ambiguous threat, but the chances of an American intervention remained unclear on Tuesday. As has long been the case with Iran, the uncertainty left space for rumors to swirl. There were unconfirmed reports that the country's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was considering escaping into exile in Russia if the protests escalated out of control. Other reports have speculated that the government could even launch a new attack on Israel — something the regime has said it is ready for since the 12-day war in June — in a bid to divert attention away from domestic problems and refocus the population's anger at Iran's biggest foreign adversary, which would likely respond quickly and harshly. But Iran's intelligence services have a history of leaking false information to the media, especially foreign outlets, to create an exaggerated narrative that the country's leaders can then deny and portray as deliberate Western disinformation. In the meantime, the government has tried to quash the unrest on the streets not only with security forces, but with a series of measures aimed at showing sympathy with the protesters, including freezing some commodity prices and taxes on businesses, and even a dramatic move Monday to announce cash subsidies for essential goods for all households. The government does appear to have been bracing for unrest in the wake of the summer war with Israel, which constrained its sanctions-squeezed budgets even further and forced slashes to subsidies and social services. So far, however, even if the protests haven't continued escalating —   which is difficult to gauge as Iran's government tightly controls the flow of information inside the country —   the efforts to quell the unrest haven't fully succeeded. In the meantime, the demonstrations continue, as people wait for any further signals from Mr. Trump that he might be willing to try to take advantage of a vulnerable moment for the Islamic Republic's rulers.

""I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that,"" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent Iranian news website IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday, referring to Mr. Trump's remarks. ""The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people."" Iranian officials have not confirmed the deaths of any protesters, and while acknowledging the demonstrations and economic pain felt in the country, they make little mention of the violence seen on the streets and accuse the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the unrest. The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency claimed Monday that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest. The U.S. State Department has issued statements condemning specific incidents in Iran since Mr. Trump leveled his ambiguous threat, but the chances of an American intervention remained unclear on Tuesday. As has long been the case with Iran, the uncertainty left space for rumors to swirl. There were unconfirmed reports that the country's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was considering escaping into exile in Russia if the protests escalated out of control. Other reports have speculated that the government could even launch a new attack on Israel — something the regime has said it is ready for since the 12-day war in June — in a bid to divert attention away from domestic problems and refocus the population's anger at Iran's biggest foreign adversary, which would likely respond quickly and harshly. But Iran's intelligence services have a history of leaking false information to the media, especially foreign outlets, to create an exaggerated narrative that the country's leaders can then deny and portray as deliberate Western disinformation. In the meantime, the government has tried to quash the unrest on the streets not only with security forces, but with a series of measures aimed at showing sympathy with the protesters, including freezing some commodity prices and taxes on businesses, and even a dramatic move Monday to announce cash subsidies for essential goods for all households. The government does appear to have been bracing for unrest in the wake of the summer war with Israel, which constrained its sanctions-squeezed budgets even further and forced slashes to subsidies and social services. So far, however, even if the protests haven't continued escalating —   which is difficult to gauge as Iran's government tightly controls the flow of information inside the country —   the efforts to quell the unrest haven't fully succeeded. In the meantime, the demonstrations continue, as people wait for any further signals from Mr. Trump that he might be willing to try to take advantage of a vulnerable moment for the Islamic Republic's rulers.

A source briefed on the Trump administration's planning has told U.S. lawmakers that at least some members of that inner circle who, like Maduro, have been charged with crimes in the U.S., could be targets for further American military and law enforcement action. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on CBS' ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" that an operation to capture at least four of Venezuela's top officials in separate locations was deemed too complicated ahead of the U.S. strikes on the country, leading to the operation focused solely on Maduro as the top target, along with his wife. Below is a look at some of the senior members of the Maduro regime who remain in Caracas, in some cases with U.S. bounties on their heads. Delcy Rodríguez The most senior member of Maduro's inner circle untouched by the U.S. attacks and raid over the weekend is the country's former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in soon after the American raid as the new interim president, taking the reins from her longtime political mentor. The 56-year-old has long been seen as a loyal confidant and protege of the now-deposed Venezuelan leader, and a member of a cadre accused by Washington for many years of helping Maduro maintain his authoritarian grip on power. It remains unclear if Rodríguez and the Trump administration might find a way to work together, and thus whether she might remain in power to some degree following Mr. Trump's assertion that the United States will ""run"" Venezuela for some unspecified period. Mr. Trump warned after Maduro's capture that if Rodríguez ""doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro."" Diosdado Cabello Another stalwart of the Maduro regime is Diosdado Cabello , who currently serves as Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, giving him oversight of the country's police and prisons. Cabello previously served as vice president, and for many years as president of the country's parliament. He also spent years in command of Venezuelan intelligence services. Like Maduro, he has been indicted on criminal charges in the United States, accused of helping to traffic more than 5 tons of cocaine to the U.S. He was first charged in 2020 with various federal drugs and weapons offenses in an indictment filed in the same Southern District of New York where Maduro was arraigned. The indictment named Cabello as a senior figure in the Cartel del los Soles, which Maduro is accused of leading. He was hit with further charges in a superceding indictment filed as the U.S. launched the attack on Venezuela. He's been described as the ""chief thug"" in terms of running Venezuela's domestic security forces, who helped keep Maduro in power, and the indictment lays out his alleged ties to drug cartels. Cabello could be among the targets of further U.S. military and law enforcement action, the source told CBS News' Brennan on Wednesday. There is a U.S. government reward of $25 million on offer for information leading to Cabello's capture. Vladimir Padrino López Vladimir Padrino López, currently serving as Venezuela's Minister of Defense, is also accused of direct involvement in trafficking drugs into the U.S. The U.S. accuses him of allowing the safe passage of commercial flights carrying illegal drugs, and of collecting a protection fee for doing so, and he was indicted in a federal court in Washington D.C. in 2020. Padrino, who has longstanding ties with Russia, also has a U.S. bounty on his head , with a $15 million reward on offer. Jorge Rodríguez The new interim president's brother, Jorge Rodríguez, has served as President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, the country's Maduro-controlled legislature, since 2021. He's also considered a key figure in the regime. ""My main function in the days to come... as president of this National Assembly, will be to resort to all procedures, all platforms, and all avenues to bring back Nicolas Maduro Moros, my brother, my president,"" Jorge Rodriguez told lawmakers. Just like his sister, Rodríguez has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury over his alleged role in undermining democracy in Venezuela and propping up Maduro's authoritarian regime. Nicolás ""Nicolasito"" Ernesto Maduro Guerra One of Maduro's sons, along with his mother Cilia, who was arraigned with her husband in New York on Monday, was also charged in 2020 with drug offenses relating to the Cartel de los Soles. Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, 35, known in the country as Nicolasito, or Little Nicolás, is currently the deputy president of the legislature.

See earlier developments below. What to know about Maduro's arrest and Trump's Venezuela operation Former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro spent the night at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn after a daring overnight U.S. military operation yanked him and his wife from the capital of Caracas over the weekend and brought them to New York to face narco-terrorism charges. Maduro and his wife pleaded not guilty and appeared defiant in their initial court appearance, with the deposed leader claiming he is ""still president of my country."" Top Trump administration officials briefed lawmakers on the operation Monday, facing largely enthusiastic Republicans and skeptical Democrats. Questions remain about Venezuela's future, including when the country will have elections, whether the Maduro loyalists who still control Venezuela will be able to work with the U.S. and how Mr. Trump's vow to ""run"" Venezuela will work. Mr. Trump wants oil companies to invest in Venezuela as soon as possible. Russia dispatches submarine to tanker linked to Venezuelan oil trade, officials say A Russian submarine and other naval vessels have been deployed to escort a sanctioned tanker that has historically carried Venezuelan oil, as the U.S. continues its weeks-long pursuit of the ship, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the escort. American forces are planning to intercept the Marinera tanker, which has been followed by the U.S. since last month, CBS News first reported on Monday . It's unclear where the U.S. plans stand now that Russian naval assets are being dispatched to escort the oil tanker, and it's not uncommon for military operations to be shelved entirely. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month. The Marinera was previously flagged out of Panama, and like the other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading. But it is now sailing under the Russian flag, which could complicate the situation given the U.S.'s delicate relationship with Russia. https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/venezuela-maduro-jail-trump-future/#post-update-17daff18 link copied Machado says Venezuelans are ""very grateful"" to Trump for ousting Maduro, after he suggests she can't lead the country Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado hailed President Trump for removing Nicolás Maduro from power and argued her coalition has a mandate to lead the country moving forward — even as Mr. Trump leaves doubts about whether Machado could take power herself. Machado spoke to ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil in a network exclusive three days after the U.S. military captured Maduro, an operation Machado has strongly supported. But Mr. Trump has declined to back Machado's movement. He said Saturday that it would be ""very tough"" for her to run Venezuela and doubted she has enough support within the country. Pressed on why she believes Mr. Trump said that about her, Machado suggested there could be lingering worries about Venezuela's stability. She told CBS News that Venezuela ""has been taken over by a criminal narcoterrorist system"" backed by guerrilla groups and U.S. adversaries like Iran and Cuba, and ""there is fear that these groups will resist a peaceful transition."" However, Machado said she believes ""a wide majority of the military and police in Venezuela also support an orderly transition to democracy."" She continued: ""I believe we have a united country.""

Machado spoke with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil in a network exclusive, saying, ""We are ready and willing to serve our people, as we have been mandated."" The former legislator won a primary race to run against Maduro in Venezuela's 2024 presidential election. The government then banned her from running, but retired diplomat Edmundo González stepped in as a replacement. The U.S. and other governments recognized González as the winner after the Maduro government was accused of rigging the vote tallies.

""I am pleased to announce that the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. The president claimed that the oil would be sold at ""Market Price,"" and that the revenue from those sales ""will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!""

Experts who study drug trafficking told CBS News these claims are exaggerated. Venezuela plays a relatively limited role in bringing cocaine to the U.S. and has virtually no link to the trafficking of fentanyl — the synthetic opioid that causes most overdose deaths, experts say.

Russia dispatches submarine to tanker linked to Venezuelan oil trade, officials say A Russian submarine and other naval vessels have been deployed to escort a sanctioned tanker that has historically carried Venezuelan oil, as the U.S. continues its weeks-long pursuit of the ship, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the escort. American forces are planning to intercept the Marinera tanker, which has been followed by the U.S. since last month, CBS News first reported on Monday . It's unclear where the U.S. plans stand now that Russian naval assets are being dispatched to escort the oil tanker, and it's not uncommon for military operations to be shelved entirely. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month. The Marinera was previously flagged out of Panama, and like the other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading. But it is now sailing under the Russian flag, which could complicate the situation given the U.S.'s delicate relationship with Russia. https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/venezuela-maduro-jail-trump-future/#post-update-17daff18 link copied Machado says Venezuelans are ""very grateful"" to Trump for ousting Maduro, after he suggests she can't lead the country Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado hailed President Trump for removing Nicolás Maduro from power and argued her coalition has a mandate to lead the country moving forward — even as Mr. Trump leaves doubts about whether Machado could take power herself.

Experts who study drug trafficking told CBS News these claims are exaggerated. Venezuela plays a relatively limited role in bringing cocaine to the U.S. and has virtually no link to the trafficking of fentanyl — the synthetic opioid that causes most overdose deaths, experts say.

In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next. Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, ""American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again"" — dubbing his approach the ""Don-roe Doctrine,"" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept. It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries. Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president: Greenland Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security , a point he made again Sunday. ""We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,"" he said. ""We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security."" ""Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,"" Mr. Trump continued. ""To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled."" Administration officials are discussing a ""range of options"" to acquire Greenland, including using military force, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday . The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, ""It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S."" In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that ""what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there."" Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself. A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment "" Soon, "" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon. Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, ""There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking — of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland."" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, ""we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days."" Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation ""fantasies"" and writing: ""That's enough now."" On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying ""security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them."" Iran Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed . In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran ""violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue."" He said the U.S. is ""locked and loaded."" The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, ""We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States."" In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity. Cuba On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, ""Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,"" adding that he didn't know ""if they're going to hold out."" Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: ""If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit."" A day later, on NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" he said of Cuba, ""they're in a lot of trouble."" Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, ""I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro."" Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's ""internal intelligence."" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro. For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island. ""I don't think we need any action"" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba ""now has no income — they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall."" In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters , which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd. Colombia The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking. ""Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, ""It sounds good to me. You know what … they kill a lot of people."" The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he ""has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity."" Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes. Petro — who once belonged to a guerilla group — warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he ""swore never to touch a weapon again,"" but ""for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want."" Canada While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the ""51st state,"" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation. But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying ""our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses."" Panama Canal Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal — drawing flak from Panama's government . The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979. He claimed in March that he was ""reclaiming the Panama Canal,"" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of ""lying again."" What is the Monroe Doctrine? In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances. During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.

All Rights Reserved.","6 countries where the ""Don-roe Doctrine"" may take Trump next Updated on:  January 6, 2026 / 9:58 PM EST / CBS News President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S . In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next. Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, ""American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again"" — dubbing his approach the ""Don-roe Doctrine,"" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept. It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries. Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president: Greenland Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security , a point he made again Sunday. ""We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,"" he said. ""We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security."" ""Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,"" Mr. Trump continued. ""To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled."" Administration officials are discussing a ""range of options"" to acquire Greenland, including using military force, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday . The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, ""It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S."" In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that ""what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there."" Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself. A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment "" Soon, "" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon. Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, ""There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking — of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland."" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, ""we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days."" Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation ""fantasies"" and writing: ""That's enough now."" On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying ""security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them."" Iran Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed . In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran ""violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue."" He said the U.S. is ""locked and loaded."" The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, ""We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States."" In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.

Brinley Bruton reporting from Bogotá, Colombia, and a Caracas-based reporter who is not being identified because of safety concerns. CARACAS, Venezuela — Political reality is settling in for Venezuela as the regime once led by deposed President Nicolás Maduro tightens its hold on the country. Many Venezuelans opposed to Maduro’s rule were overjoyed when U.S. special forces captured him over the weekend, believing this would be quickly followed by a transition to a form of a new government. But for some, these hopes have dimmed in recent days. No political prisoners appear to have been released, and the government is cracking down on any new signs of dissent, arresting people they said celebrated Maduro’s capture by the United States military. The country’s security and intelligence apparatus is out in force, with masked paramilitary “colectivos” — armed civilians who support the government — roaming the streets on motorcycles, and military intelligence agents in civilian clothes circulating in vans with an official insignia and setting up roadblocks. The entire top leadership remains intact, with the notable exception of Maduro himself. The lack of change in government was underlined by a recent classified intelligence assessment that determined that top members of the Maduro regime — including former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday — were best positioned to lead Venezuela’s government and maintain stability. That assessment factored in President Donald Trump’s dismissal of Maria Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as the best person to take over running the country, sources told NBC News. These developments were a gut-punch for Michelle, a resident of Caracas. “For many years I wished for my country’s government to change, and I thought that when that day came I would feel very happy. But that’s not the case,” said the 34-year-old architect, who moved back to Venezuela last year. “Somehow we will have to pay: either with oil or with our own dignity and sovereignty.” Michelle and others who spoke to NBC News in Venezuela asked not to be fully identified out of fear the government would punish them. “A dangerous precedent is being created between the United States and Latin America,” Michelle said. “We realize that we are just another piece on the board in the struggle between powers, for whom the future of the Venezuelan people lacks relevance compared to the importance of valuable resources, which are worth more than life itself.”      Add NBC News to Google Trump has repeatedly referred to his desire for Venezuela, which sits on the world’s largest oil reserves, to open its market to American companies. On Tuesday he said Venezuela would “be turning over” up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., adding that the revenue from the oil will be used to benefit both Americans and Venezuelans. But pessimism about recent events in Venezuela isn’t shared by all opposition supporters, including former political prisoner Luis Mata. “It’s like eating a pizza — they go slice by slice. We have to trust the process,” the political activist and human rights defender living in exile told NBC News. Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024. Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory. Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocorón jail. He is now outside Venezuela. “Many say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,” he said. “For me, change is closer than ever. Nicolás is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,” added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. “Freedom is about to arrive.” Whether or not “freedom” is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as president and the country’s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday. In the photograph released by the presidential palace, Rodríguez is flanked on one side by her brother and the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez. On her right is Diosdado Cabello, who as minister of the interior minister, justice and peace oversees police, counterintelligence forces and the “colectivos” that have struck fear among many Venezuelans. Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicolás Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader. The image runs counter to repeated statements by Trump asserting that the U.S. is “in charge” in Venezuela. “They’re going after anybody who potentially supported the U.S. mission to get Maduro,” James Story, the last U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. “They’re going to go round them up, and they’ve already rounded up some people.

Brinley Bruton reporting from Bogotá, Colombia, and a Caracas-based reporter who is not being identified because of safety concerns. CARACAS, Venezuela — Political reality is settling in for Venezuela as the regime once led by deposed President Nicolás Maduro tightens its hold on the country. Many Venezuelans opposed to Maduro’s rule were overjoyed when U.S. special forces captured him over the weekend, believing this would be quickly followed by a transition to a form of a new government. But for some, these hopes have dimmed in recent days. No political prisoners appear to have been released, and the government is cracking down on any new signs of dissent, arresting people they said celebrated Maduro’s capture by the United States military. The country’s security and intelligence apparatus is out in force, with masked paramilitary “colectivos” — armed civilians who support the government — roaming the streets on motorcycles, and military intelligence agents in civilian clothes circulating in vans with an official insignia and setting up roadblocks. The entire top leadership remains intact, with the notable exception of Maduro himself. The lack of change in government was underlined by a recent classified intelligence assessment that determined that top members of the Maduro regime — including former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday — were best positioned to lead Venezuela’s government and maintain stability. That assessment factored in President Donald Trump’s dismissal of Maria Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as the best person to take over running the country, sources told NBC News. These developments were a gut-punch for Michelle, a resident of Caracas. “For many years I wished for my country’s government to change, and I thought that when that day came I would feel very happy. But that’s not the case,” said the 34-year-old architect, who moved back to Venezuela last year. “Somehow we will have to pay: either with oil or with our own dignity and sovereignty.” Michelle and others who spoke to NBC News in Venezuela asked not to be fully identified out of fear the government would punish them. “A dangerous precedent is being created between the United States and Latin America,” Michelle said. “We realize that we are just another piece on the board in the struggle between powers, for whom the future of the Venezuelan people lacks relevance compared to the importance of valuable resources, which are worth more than life itself.”      Add NBC News to Google Trump has repeatedly referred to his desire for Venezuela, which sits on the world’s largest oil reserves, to open its market to American companies. On Tuesday he said Venezuela would “be turning over” up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., adding that the revenue from the oil will be used to benefit both Americans and Venezuelans. But pessimism about recent events in Venezuela isn’t shared by all opposition supporters, including former political prisoner Luis Mata. “It’s like eating a pizza — they go slice by slice. We have to trust the process,” the political activist and human rights defender living in exile told NBC News. Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024. Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory. Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocorón jail. He is now outside Venezuela. “Many say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,” he said. “For me, change is closer than ever. Nicolás is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,” added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. “Freedom is about to arrive.” Whether or not “freedom” is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as president and the country’s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday. In the photograph released by the presidential palace, Rodríguez is flanked on one side by her brother and the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez. On her right is Diosdado Cabello, who as minister of the interior minister, justice and peace oversees police, counterintelligence forces and the “colectivos” that have struck fear among many Venezuelans. Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicolás Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader. The image runs counter to repeated statements by Trump asserting that the U.S. is “in charge” in Venezuela. “They’re going after anybody who potentially supported the U.S. mission to get Maduro,” James Story, the last U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. “They’re going to go round them up, and they’ve already rounded up some people. If they’re doing that, then we don’t run the country,” said Story, who served as ambassador from 2018 to 2023.

President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodríguez had been “sworn in” as president and stood “willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.” Rodríguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela’s “only president,” while also pledging to “collaborate” with the Trump administration. Rodríguez’s de facto leadership of Venezuela caps a remarkable political ascent for an official who has served in a variety of roles in the governments of both the late socialist President Hugo Chávez and Maduro, who once called her a “tiger” for her vociferous defense of his left-wing authoritarian regime. Here’s what you need to know about Rodríguez, 56, as Maduro faces a federal indictment in the United States and the immediate fate of Venezuela hangs in the balance. Revolutionary roots Rodríguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodríguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League, a militant revolutionary party that was particularly active in the 1970s. Jorge Antonio Rodríguez was arrested in connection with his alleged involvement in the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F. Niehous . The elder Rodríguez died in police custody at the age of 34. The saga became a foundational memory for his daughter and one of the raisons d’etre for her political career. “The revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,” Delcy Rodríguez was quoted as telling a Venezuelan politician in 2018, referring to Chávez’s socialist political program. She has close political ties with her older brother, Jorge Rodríguez, a psychiatrist by training who serves as president of the National Assembly, the country’s unicameral legislature. He was the country’s vice president under Chávez, who died in 2013. Extensive résum é Rodríguez is a lawyer by training who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela in 1993. She went on to study labor law in Paris and social sciences in London before she launched her Venezuelan political career in the early 2000s. She held various low-profile positions in the Chávez regime before she took on a more visible profile as communication and information minister in 2013. Then came the job of foreign minister, from 2014 to 2017, as well as a role heading the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly. Rodríguez’s loyalty to Maduro earned her influence and stature, according to Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. It was the principal reason she was “handpicked” for the vice presidency in June 2018, making her second in the country’s line of succession, Berg said. “She has survived in multiple positions because of her ability to exercise power effectively within that regime,” Berg told NBC News. In a post on social media announcing Rodríguez’s ascension to the vice presidency, Maduro described her as “a young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary and tested in a thousand battles.” In recent years, Rodríguez added even more responsibilities to her vice presidential portfolio, taking on roles as finance and oil minister. The latter gave her oversight over Venezuela’s most crucial business sector and coveted export — and tested her resolve as she attempted to deal with severe U.S. sanctions on the country’s oil industry and the toll of inflation. Rodríguez has never faced U.S. criminal charges, though she was sanctioned by the first Trump administration for the role she allegedly played in squashing political dissent in Venezuela. Uncertainty ahead It remains to be seen whether Rodríguez will stay in power, and the rhetoric from the leaders of both Venezuela and the U.S. has fluctuated since Maduro’s stunning capture. Trump said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in contact with Rodríguez, describing her as “gracious” and willing to work with the American government as it prosecutes Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in New York. In a televised address, Rodríguez struck a more antagonistic tone, reportedly blasting the “extremists” in the Trump administration and insisting that Maduro was Venezuela’s rightful leader despite his capture and indictment by the U.S. government. “What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” Rodríguez said, according to The Associated Press. In an Instagram post on Sunday , Rodríguez used far more diplomatic language, emphasizing the need for a more “balanced and respectful relationship” between Venezuela and the U.S. “We extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperation agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” Rodríguez wrote in part. Trump then presented a stark warning to Rodríguez, telling a reporter for The Atlantic : “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” Even if Rodríguez’s interim role turns into a more permanent position, she will still need to fortify her political standing inside Venezuela and what remains of the Maduro regime, according to Berg. “She does not enjoy support from some of the main factions” in Venezuela, Berg said, “and most importantly, she’ll have to consolidate support over the armed forces.” Daniel Arkin is a senior reporter at NBC News.","Who is Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's interim leader after the capture of Nicolás Maduro?

nbc_world,Cubans brace for even more economic devastation amid threat of no Venezuelan oil,"Cuba’s economy, already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further.",https://www.nbcnews.com/world/latin-america/cubans-brace-even-economic-devastation-threat-no-venezuelan-oil-rcna252430,"Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:42:19 GMT",2026-01-06 23:42:19,"     Add NBC News to Google       Add NBC News to Google HAVANA — The ripple effects from the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on Saturday could make their way quickly here, devastating this island that has been in a yearslong economic crisis. Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba’s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba’s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further. “If oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,” said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. “This would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.” Expecting more hardship In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%. “The situation here is going to become very difficult,” said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. “Imagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts … young people are going to become even more pessimistic.” There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Piñón, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn’t mean “ghost ships” with their transponders turned off haven’t slipped in. Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day. “That’s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,” Piñón said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia. Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country’s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was “partially paralyzed.” Content creator Pedro Luis García said: “We don’t know what the economic situation will be, but it will likely worsen because of the oil. But I don’t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.” Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%. Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen. Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government’s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns. For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island’s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba’s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity. The capital, Havana, once insulated from blackouts, now faces 10 hours or more without electricity each day. In other parts of the country, the blackouts can extend to 20 hours. Oil shipments from Venezuela are likely to stop if Trump gets his way. Cuba’s second biggest supplier of oil, Mexico, is also facing pressure from Trump. He recently suggested the U.S. can take action against the country, saying drugs were “pouring” through Mexico and that “we’re going to have to do something.” A defiant government response The day Maduro was captured, Cuba’s president condemned and denounced the U.S. actions in a defiant speech . Díaz-Canel said that U.S. actions were not about Maduro, his government or even drug trafficking, but that the “obscure object of imperialist desire was Venezuelan petroleum, the lands and natural resources of Venezuela.” Díaz-Canel also said that “for Venezuela, and of course also for Cuba, we are willing to give our own blood, even our own lives, at a very high price.” Cuba’s government said 32 of its military and security personnel were killed Saturday. Cuba’s state-run media, including television and the official newspaper Granma, published pictures of the 32 officers killed, along with their names, ages and ranks. In an interview with “Meet the Press,” Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, declined to say what kind of further actions the U.S. could take against Cuba. “I’m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard,” he said. “But I don’t think it’s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.” Cuba is already under heavy U.S. sanctions, but there are still other actions the U.S. can take. During Trump’s first administration, the U.S. banned all flights to Cuba except for Havana. In Havana, former senior Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told NBC News, “We need to see what repercussions this will have. But the world hasn’t ended as it seemed, and as Marco Rubio and Donald Trump would like to portray it.” “I believe they are using intimidation to see if they can affect relations between Venezuela and Cuba, which I would say are not currently affected because Cuba and most Cubans support Venezuela in condemning the U.S. aggression,” he said. Alzugaray added that Cuba’s government should be in the midst of intense conversations and consultations with its allies, like China and Russia. Cuba, with a Soviet-style command economy, has been unwilling to loosen restrictions on the private sector and open its economy to foreign investment, as many allies like Vietnam and China have urged it to do. Vidal, the economist, said that when the USSR collapsed, it took the Cuban economy four years to hit rock bottom and begin to recover. Tourism, remittances and foreign investment helped rescue the economy from collapse in those years, something that hasn’t happened this time around. “Today, there is widespread distrust among the Cuban government’s own international allies regarding the viability of its economic model and its finances,” Vidal said. “In the 1990s, there was a stronger and more respected political leadership, both nationally and internationally, which is not the case now.” Orlando Matos reported from Havana and Carmen Sesin from Miami.

Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba’s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba’s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further. “If oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,” said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. “This would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.” Expecting more hardship In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%. “The situation here is going to become very difficult,” said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. “Imagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts … young people are going to become even more pessimistic.” There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Piñón, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn’t mean “ghost ships” with their transponders turned off haven’t slipped in. Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day. “That’s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,” Piñón said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia. Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country’s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was “partially paralyzed.” Content creator Pedro Luis García said: “We don’t know what the economic situation will be, but it will likely worsen because of the oil. But I don’t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.” Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%. Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen. Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government’s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns. For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island’s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba’s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity. The capital, Havana, once insulated from blackouts, now faces 10 hours or more without electricity each day. In other parts of the country, the blackouts can extend to 20 hours. Oil shipments from Venezuela are likely to stop if Trump gets his way. Cuba’s second biggest supplier of oil, Mexico, is also facing pressure from Trump. He recently suggested the U.S. can take action against the country, saying drugs were “pouring” through Mexico and that “we’re going to have to do something.” A defiant government response The day Maduro was captured, Cuba’s president condemned and denounced the U.S. actions in a defiant speech . Díaz-Canel said that U.S. actions were not about Maduro, his government or even drug trafficking, but that the “obscure object of imperialist desire was Venezuelan petroleum, the lands and natural resources of Venezuela.” Díaz-Canel also said that “for Venezuela, and of course also for Cuba, we are willing to give our own blood, even our own lives, at a very high price.” Cuba’s government said 32 of its military and security personnel were killed Saturday. Cuba’s state-run media, including television and the official newspaper Granma, published pictures of the 32 officers killed, along with their names, ages and ranks.

In a private phone call a week ago, Trump told Nicolás Maduro that he had to go. By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela’s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro’s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled. “You got to surrender,” Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home. Maduro took the gamble of his life. He “came close” to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put. Follow live updates That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch. This account of “Operation Absolute Resolve,” the most audacious military action in either of Trump’s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements. As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing “extraordinary insight” into Maduro’s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan “Raizin” Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday. Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News — the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called “massive blowtorches” in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro’s safe room. At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said. That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said. Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said , however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people. The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro “cries uncle.” She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval — something the White House hasn’t gotten. “If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then [we’d need] Congress,” Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple. The same month, America’s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro. “A lot of ships out there,” Trump said at the news conference. Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning. Venezuela wasn’t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians. At a New Year’s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026. “Peace on Earth,” he said . So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn’t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination. Vice President JD Vance went to Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said. Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared — acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews. The mission was on. “Good luck and Godspeed,” Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said. Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn’t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn’t want lawmakers to leak details. At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49. Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela’s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added. Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna , a large military complex in Caracas. By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. “A heavily fortified military fortress,” Trump called it. When Delta Force breached Maduro’s residence, he and his wife were taken “completely by surprise,” Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn’t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody. A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official. By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke . The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place. Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media . “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” he wrote . A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded. By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance. He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a “cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,"" the indictment alleges. Following the strike, Trump made it clear that “Operation Absolute Resolve” wasn’t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of “America First” foreign policy. In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he’ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business. “The Donroe Doctrine,” Trump called it. The U.S. isn’t leaving Venezuela soon, he said. “We’re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.” Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command. “Now,” Trump said, “he wished he did.” Peter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News.

As he turned to go back inside, he told NBC News at the scene Friday, “hell” erupted as a deadly fire broke out. “I heard a big boom, and everybody was screaming,” he said. Mehari said a thick smoke enveloped the venue and the crowd, blinding him. He fell to the ground as people rushed to escape the bar, he said, but a man pulled him away to safety. His friends were not so lucky, he says. “I have four friends who died,” he said, still struggling to process the loss. “For me, it’s not real.” Mehari, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said he saw someone he knew from school disfigured and burning, and others whose hair and clothes had burned off. “Somebody was dying in front of me and I couldn’t do anything,” he said. “Her face was so burned it was red.” The bar was popular with local teenagers, he said. The legal drinking age is 16 in Switzerland. Mehari was among survivors taken to a hospital ward in Sion, where he was offered mental health assistance. “I tried to sleep, but I can’t,” he said. Mehari’s was among the harrowing witness accounts emerging Friday as investigators searched for answers. At least 40 people are dead and 119 injured, officials said, many of them with serious burns that a senior doctor treating them said will require “months of rehabilitation” and even have “lifelong consequences.” Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press that he lost his jacket, shoes and phone while fleeing, though he was grateful to have made it out. “I am still alive and it’s just stuff,” he said. “I’m still in shock.” Samuel Rapp said he was at a restaurant next door when the fire broke out. “A lot of people were screaming and it was horrible,” Rapp told NBC News’ British broadcasting partner Sky News. “People were walking on everybody,” he said, adding that he “saw a lot of people on the floor, and I think these people were dead because someone put jackets on their faces.” Laetitia Place, 17, said she was caught up in the chaos. “There’s the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell, we were piled on top of each other, some people were burning, and some were dead next to us,” she told Reuters. “I was so scared — scared for myself, scared for my friends, scared for everyone inside.” She added: “We all saw really horrible things that no one should ever have to see.” Eric Bonvin, the general director of the regional hospital in Sion that took in several dozen injured people, said those with severe burns face months of treatment. The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital. Injured survivors suffered burns to varying degrees, not just to their skin but also to their airways. “There were inhalations of both smoke and also of heat that for some probably led to internal burns. That’s a really catastrophic situation, as you can imagine,” Bonvin said. “It was hard to live through for everyone. Also probably because everyone was asking themselves, ‘Was my child, my cousin, someone from the region at this party?’ This place was very well known as somewhere to celebrate the new year,” Bonvin said. “Also, seeing young people arrive — that’s always traumatic.” The road to recovery for the gravely injured will likely be long and arduous, he cautioned. “For those with serious burns, intensive care treatment lasts several months,” he said. “But it’s not without hope,” he added. “They are young, and that means they still have a lot of vitality.” Daniele Hamamdjian reported from Crans-Montana, Switzerland.

Here’s a look at some of the landmark events to come this year. Milan Cortina Games Grab your skis, snowboard and skates — it’s almost time for the Winter Olympics and Paralympics. The Games will unfold in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy, from Feb. 6 to 22, when the international stars of winter sports will compete for Olympic gold and glory. The opening ceremony, which will be hosted by “TODAY” show anchor Savannah Guthrie and NBC Sports’ Terry Gannon , will be held at the San Siro soccer stadium in Milan. The celebration will feature the parade of delegations, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron, a performance by Mariah Carey and an act by Italian actor Pierfrancesco Favino . Some Team USA favorites returning this year are cross-country skier Jessie Diggins , para snowboarder Noah Elliot , freestyle skier Alex Hall and snowboarder Chloe Kim — all gold medalists. The closing ceremony is set for Feb. 22. Both ceremonies will air on NBC and be available to stream on Peacock. The Paralympic Games will take place March 6 to 14, also in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, featuring six sports: para Alpine skiing, para biathlon, para cross-country skiing, para ice hockey, para snowboard and wheelchair curling. Artemis II launch 2026 is the year NASA finally returns to the moon — sort of. The Artemis II mission, the next step in NASA’s return-to-the-moon program, is expected to launch sometime from February to April. The flight will be a key test of NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon to evaluate how the Orion spacecraft’s various systems and hardware function in a deep space environment. The mission will be the first crewed flight of the Artemis program, and it will take the astronauts to the closest point humans have come to the moon in more than 50 years, since the end of the Apollo program. It will be closely watched, particularly as the Trump administration has repeatedly talked about the need to return to the moon before China lands its astronauts on the lunar surface. Much of that vision hinges on the outcome of the Artemis II mission. If it succeeds, the flight will pave the way for the Artemis III mission, which is expected to land astronauts near the moon’s south pole. In a recent executive order, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 “to assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire the next generation of American explorers.” More coverage Here’s where the U.S. is likeliest to medal at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics From ‘Quad god’ to a Kelce favorite, these are the potential breakout stars of the Milan Cortina Olympics 2026 will be the year NASA astronauts fly around the moon again — if all goes to plan Where are the Democratic and Republican parties going next?

The FIFA World Cup, the world’s premier international soccer competition, returns for its 23rd tournament this summer. This year, a record 48 teams will battle for glory across three host countries — the U.S., Canada and Mexico, a first. The spectacle will kick off with the opening match June 11 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The finale is set for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Over the month, 104 matches will unfold, seeing the best of each nation go head to head. The 16 host cities are Toronto and Vancouver in Canada; Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey in Mexico; and Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York-New Jersey, Philadelphia, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle in the U.S. This year features 16 more teams than the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Returning this year are defending champions Argentina (three-time World Cup winners), the soccer legends of Brazil (record five-time winners), England (which won when it hosted the cup in 1966), Germany (a four-time winner), France (two-time winners, including as recently as 2018), Spain (2010 champions), Uruguay (two-time winners) and the U.S. — which has yet to claim the coveted title. Nations making their World Cup debuts are Cape Verde, Curaçao , Jordan and Uzbekistan. As of December, 42 teams have qualified, including Mexico, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Ghana, Iran, Japan, South Korea, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. The remaining six will be determined by March, with four teams coming from the European playoffs and the two others from the World Cup playoff tournament, according to FIFA . America 250 This year, the U.S. will celebrate its 250th birthday , commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. That day marked the foundation of the United States as a sovereign nation, severing from British colonial rule and enshrining America’s enduring creeds of equality and “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Events and initiatives to commemorate the anniversary are already underway, with many scheduled throughout the year. On New Year’s Day, America250 , the nonpartisan effort that Congress established in 2016 to plan for the anniversary, will have a float in the Rose Parade in Pasadena, Calif. Its theme is “Soaring Onward Together for 250 Years.” In January 2025, Trump issued an executive order to plan events to mark the anniversary. He later announced Freedom 250, a nonpartisan initiative launched at his direction to plan additional celebratory events. Those events kicked off on New Year’s Eve with the Washington Monument being transformed into the “world’s tallest birthday candle” by projections being displayed nightly through Jan. 5. A “Great American State Fair” will take place on the National Mall, featuring pavilions from all 50 states, from June 25 to July 10, according to Freedom 250. “Frankly, you’ll never see anything like it, and you’ll never see anything like it again,” Trump said in a video address on Dec. 18. The festivities will be capped with a “unifying national celebration on the National Mall” on Independence Day, including a flyover by the military, an address by Trump and a fireworks display. The group also announced the first “Patriot Games” — a four-day athletic competition featuring top high school athletes, one young man and one young woman, from each state and territory. In addition, there will be a parade for Memorial Day and a UFC event at the White House on Flag Day, June 14, which is also Trump’s birthday. Trump also said he plans to build a “triumphal arc,” similar to Paris’ Arc de Triomphe, in the nation’s capital. Midterm elections The battle for control of Congress , as well as key governor’s races and downballot elections across the country, will dominate the 2026 political calendar. Republicans are defending a narrow majority in the House — Democrats need to net just three seats to take back control (a task that could be complicated by the ongoing redistricting wildfire that has swept state legislatures across the country). The GOP’s defense of its Senate majority is likely to be easier, as Democrats need to net four more seats there, and most of that battlefield runs through states Trump won in 2024. There will also be major governor’s races in key swing states like Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin; legislative races that could determine control of legislatures across the country; and mayoral races in cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Hikage, a kindergarten principal in Japan ’s Akita prefecture, has been on patrol every day since bears were spotted nearby in October, setting off firecrackers and playing human voices with a radio to scare them away. The bear sightings in places such as Odate, a city of almost 70,000 people, are “extremely abnormal,” said Hikage, who said bears had never been seen in the three generations his family has lived in the area. To protect his students, Hikage has also chopped down fruit and chestnut trees that might attract hungry bears, a decision he called “painful.” The trees were “here since I was little and I have lots of memories,” he said. “But first and foremost: safety first.” Residents in Japan’s scenic and mountainous north, which includes Akita, are on edge after an unprecedented rise in bear attacks , many of which have resulted in deaths or serious injuries. Bears have broken into supermarkets and hotels and raided orchards, attacking vehicles and people out of the blue. As of the end of November, 235 bear attacks had killed 13 people across Japan this year, both the highest figures since records began in 2006, according to preliminary data from the environment ministry. Many of the victims are older and live in rural areas, and were attacked while hiking or picking mushrooms. The threat of bears even prompted the U.S. Embassy to issue a rare wildlife alert last month for Americans living or traveling in Japan. Experts say Japan’s bear population — which includes at least 12,000 brown bears in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main islands — has been growing even as the rural population is aging and shrinking, leaving the bears with more room to roam and fewer people to scare them off. A shortage of tree nuts and other staples of bears’ diet — a shortage driven partly by climate change — is also drawing the animals out of the forests and mountains where they live and into residential areas. Most of the attacks have been by smaller Asian black bears and have occurred in Akita prefecture, now a front line of the crisis. Two years ago Keiji Minatoya, a baker, was attacked by a bear in the garage behind his confectionery shop in the town of Kita-Akita. The attack, which lasted about two minutes, left his face covered in blood and his forehead cracked open, exposing his skull. The bear had bitten him multiple times and clawed his back. “Also, my earlobe was bitten off, and it still hurts,” said Minatoya, 68. “So even if I don’t want to remember the attack, I’m always reminded of it, because I feel the pain every day.” Minatoya has not reopened his shop since the attack because he says his wife is too fearful. Instead, he delivers his baked goods to stores in the town to sell. Since Minatoya’s experience, attacks have only increased. Hunters, riot police and even the military have been deployed , using drones that bark like dogs, traps laced with honey and even mechanical wolves to keep the bears at bay. Both brown and black bears were added to a government list of “controlled animals” last year, and recent emergency rule changes allow them to be shot by police officers, though not military personnel. As a safety precaution, some residents wear bear bells or carry alarms and whistles when they go out. Others opt to stay indoors. Spiritual bear hunters, known locally as Matagi, are trying to help, but they’re “totally outnumbered” by the bears, said Hideaki Saito, of the Matagi Museum in the Akita town of Ani, which highlights traditional hunting culture in northern Japan. “I think they’re making a contribution, but overall, the hunting association membership right now is too small,” Saito said. “Also the average age of a Matagi is quite high and there aren’t many young people who decide to become a Matagi, or become members of the hunting association.” Saito said that, although he believes it’s necessary to control the bear population, coexistence is not just about killing. “We all benefit from bears. They are gifts from the gods,” he said. Naoi Sato, a mother of two boys, ages 8 and 3, helped children gain access to indoor facilities where they can stay active safely amid the bear sightings. “Playing outside is essential for children’s development, and I think it’s not good to stop this because of these bears,” she said. But “they can also exercise their bodies indoors, and that’s what’s important,” she said. Her family still loves living in Akita, which Sato says is a great place to raise children. But she also knows that, at least for now, the bears don’t seem to be going anywhere. “We don’t want to stop the kids’ development,” she said. “That’s why we just continue to try to have a normal life.” Janis Mackey Frayer and Arata Yamamoto reported from Odate and Peter Guo from Hong Kong.

Experts say Japan’s bear population — which includes at least 12,000 brown bears in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main islands — has been growing even as the rural population is aging and shrinking, leaving the bears with more room to roam and fewer people to scare them off. A shortage of tree nuts and other staples of bears’ diet — a shortage driven partly by climate change — is also drawing the animals out of the forests and mountains where they live and into residential areas. Most of the attacks have been by smaller Asian black bears and have occurred in Akita prefecture, now a front line of the crisis. Two years ago Keiji Minatoya, a baker, was attacked by a bear in the garage behind his confectionery shop in the town of Kita-Akita. The attack, which lasted about two minutes, left his face covered in blood and his forehead cracked open, exposing his skull. The bear had bitten him multiple times and clawed his back. “Also, my earlobe was bitten off, and it still hurts,” said Minatoya, 68. “So even if I don’t want to remember the attack, I’m always reminded of it, because I feel the pain every day.” Minatoya has not reopened his shop since the attack because he says his wife is too fearful. Instead, he delivers his baked goods to stores in the town to sell. Since Minatoya’s experience, attacks have only increased. Hunters, riot police and even the military have been deployed , using drones that bark like dogs, traps laced with honey and even mechanical wolves to keep the bears at bay. Both brown and black bears were added to a government list of “controlled animals” last year, and recent emergency rule changes allow them to be shot by police officers, though not military personnel. As a safety precaution, some residents wear bear bells or carry alarms and whistles when they go out. Others opt to stay indoors. Spiritual bear hunters, known locally as Matagi, are trying to help, but they’re “totally outnumbered” by the bears, said Hideaki Saito, of the Matagi Museum in the Akita town of Ani, which highlights traditional hunting culture in northern Japan. “I think they’re making a contribution, but overall, the hunting association membership right now is too small,” Saito said. “Also the average age of a Matagi is quite high and there aren’t many young people who decide to become a Matagi, or become members of the hunting association.” Saito said that, although he believes it’s necessary to control the bear population, coexistence is not just about killing. “We all benefit from bears. They are gifts from the gods,” he said. Naoi Sato, a mother of two boys, ages 8 and 3, helped children gain access to indoor facilities where they can stay active safely amid the bear sightings. “Playing outside is essential for children’s development, and I think it’s not good to stop this because of these bears,” she said. But “they can also exercise their bodies indoors, and that’s what’s important,” she said. Her family still loves living in Akita, which Sato says is a great place to raise children. But she also knows that, at least for now, the bears don’t seem to be going anywhere. “We don’t want to stop the kids’ development,” she said. “That’s why we just continue to try to have a normal life.” Janis Mackey Frayer and Arata Yamamoto reported from Odate and Peter Guo from Hong Kong.

Despite bombs raining down and a lack of tools, feed and medicine, the shelter has remained operational throughout the two-year conflict, working to help emaciated and injured dogs, cats, donkeys and horses. At the shelter’s site in Deir al-Balah, several dogs with three legs are among the animals running around, a stark reminder of the toll that the war has taken. In a large tent, veterinarians and volunteers work together to place an IV into the leg of a small, whimpering puppy. Dr. Hossam Mortaja, one of the few remaining veterinarians in Gaza, is often forced to improvise, using expired medicines or human drugs like amoxicillin when veterinary supplies run dry. “Animals suffer like humans — they feel fear, even convulsions,” he said. The organization shelters about 70 dogs and 50 cats, many injured or left without owners by the war. During the worst aid shortages, the team shared scarce rice, pasta and canned tuna with the animals, a desperate measure to prevent starvation. Since the war erupted in October 2023, Gaza’s animal population has plummeted. According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, an estimated 97% of the strip’s livestock has been destroyed through bombing, starvation and looting. This includes cows, sheep, goats and poultry. Large animals like donkeys and horses have dropped to around 30% of their former numbers. Stray pets have not been spared; countless dogs and cats were abandoned as families fled, leading to a surge in malnutrition, diseases like parvovirus, anemia and respiratory infections. Veterinary reports describe animals in states of “cachexia” — severe wasting — with weakened immune systems exacerbating outbreaks of gastroenteritis, jaundice and eye diseases. Sulala’s clinic treats these conditions daily. “People seek comfort in animals. Some find support in dogs, while others find it in cats. During the war, I witnessed many individuals caring for and sheltering animals, both cats and dogs. They reached out to us, and we consistently provided them with food,” Al-Aar told NBC News. The Sulala Animal Rescue team worked in dire and dangerous conditions as Israel continued its assault on Gaza. Famine conditions in Gaza City have eased since the ceasefire began in October, according to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world’s leading authority on food crises, but the situation remains critical, with the entire strip still at risk of starvation. Veterinarian Muath Talat Abo Rokba, who worked with Sulala and also ran his own veterinary clinic, was reportedly killed by Israeli forces in October, while the ceasefire was in effect. He had been visiting the ruins of his home in the Jabalia area, close to the “yellow line” marking Israeli-held territory , Sulala Animal Rescue said at the time. The IDF told NBC News that it was not aware of the specific incident. “There are no words we have about losing him,” said Annelies Keuleers, a remote volunteer and spokesperson for Sulala Animal Rescue. “In many ways, he was absolutely irreplaceable.” The shelter’s Instagram page has attracted a dedicated following amid the conflict, with 180,000 followers, many of whom are located in the West, eagerly watching for updates on Al-Aar, his team and the animals the organization helps. Keuleers, who volunteers from Belgium, told NBC News that she worries constantly for the safety of the rescue team on the ground. “Saeed and his children have been in dangerous situations to try and pick up animals that have been left behind during evacuations, that have been starving there.” She continued: “There’s been a couple of times where I hadn’t heard from anyone for a day or a day and a half. And that’s been scary, as I wasn’t sure how I would know if they were bombed or killed.” Even with a fragile ceasefire in place, human suffering in Gaza remains acute, compounding the animal plight. While the ceasefire has improved the flow of some deliveries into Gaza, the World Health Organization warned earlier this month that “humanitarian needs remain staggering, with current assistance addressing only the most basic survival requirements.” Lucia Elmi, UNICEF’s director of emergency operations, warned that fragile gains made during the ceasefire “could vanish overnight if fighting resumes, adding: “We need sustained humanitarian access, restored basic services, and above all, lasting peace.” Despite the dangers that persist for Al-Aar and the other veterinarians and volunteers, they remain devoted to helping animals, even at a time when so much human suffering persists. “They live in fear and horror, just as we do,” Al-Aar said.

The operation to seize the sanctioned vessel, which changed its name from the Bella 1 to the Marinera after fleeing the American blockade of Venezuela last month , was carried out early Wednesday. The U.S. also announced the seizure of another sanctioned tanker, the M/T Sophia, which it said was “conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea.” The Kremlin, a strong supporter of deposed President Nicolás Maduro, accused the U.S. of violating maritime law by seizing the Marinera. The ship's efforts to evade authorities were followed in real time by a fleet of observers and analysts, who also tracked as the U.S. moved military assets to the United Kingdom in recent days. The saga emerged as a new flashpoint between Washington and Moscow that threatened to undermine the Trump administration’s blockade of the Latin American country in the wake of its stunning attack and capture of Maduro. U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure of the Marinera for violating U.S. sanctions. “The vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro,” it said in a post on X. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Capitol Hill that the tankers were seized as part of ""stabilization"" efforts for Venezuela. He said that the interim authorities in Venezuela ""understand the only way they can move oil, generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States."" U.S. Southern Command, which oversees military activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, announced on X that the U.S. had also apprehended M/T Sophia, “a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker” that it said was “operating in international waters and conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea.” Emmanuel Belostrino, an oil market analyst at Kpler, said satellite imagery and port reports indicate the Sophia was “laden with around 2 million barrels of Merey crude oil, loaded from Jose Oil Terminal (JOT)” in Venezuela. Kpler, which runs the ship-tracking service MarineTraffic, said the Sophia's involvement in sanctioned trade may extend back several years. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the operations “two safe, effective boardings within hours of each other.” Noem said that the Bella 1 had been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, “even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.” The “heroic” crew of USCGC Munro, she added, pursued the vessel “across the high seas and through treacherous storms.” The U.S. seized two oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela last month as part of its blockade of sanctioned oil shipments to and from the country. The Marinera was one of a number of sanctioned oil tankers operating near Venezuela that have recently changed their flags to Russia. Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela would hand over 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., as its vast reserves emerged as a key pillar of his plans — and a point of tension with Russia and China. NBC News reported last month that the Marinera, then known as the Bella 1, had been on the U.S. sanctions list since June 2024. It was pursued by the U.S. Coast Guard off Venezuela last month, and as of Jan. 5 it was off the west coast of Scotland in the North Atlantic, according to data from the ship-tracking website MarineTraffic. Russia's Transport Ministry said in a statement following the tanker's capture that the Marinera had been granted temporary authorization to sail under the Russian flag in late December, and that it had lost all communication with the ship after U.S. forces boarded it on Wednesday. ""The high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,"" it said. The Russian Foreign Ministry told state news agency Tass it was closely monitoring the situation and demanded the humane treatment and ""prompt return"" of Russian citizens onboard. “The boarding of American military personnel on a peaceful vessel on the high seas and its actual capture, as well as the capture of the crew, cannot be interpreted as anything other than a gross violation of the fundamental principles and norms of international maritime law, as well as freedom of navigation,” the ministry said Thursday. “Washington’s readiness to generate acute international crisis situations is a cause for regret and concern, given the already severely strained Russian-American relations burdened by disagreements over the past years,” it added. Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Leonid Slutsky told Tass the seizure was ""unquestionably a violation of maritime law and UN conventions,"" while Senator Andrei Klishas, of the Putin-aligned United Russia party, said on Telegram that the U.S. had “turned to outright piracy on the high seas.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a news briefing that the Marinera was ""deemed stateless"" after ""flying a false flag."" She said the crew would be subject to prosecution under U.S. law and ""will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary."" Pressed about whether the seizure would inflame tensions with Russia, Leavitt said that Trump had an ""open, honest and good"" relationship with Vladimir Putin but that he would ""enforce our policy that's best for the United States of America, and with respect to these ship seizures, that means enforcing the embargo against all dark fleet vessels.""      Add NBC News to Google Russian propaganda TV channel RT shared what it said was exclusive footage from aboard the tanker Tuesday night. It did not say where or when the footage was shot. “Visibility is poor due to fog, and a U.S. Coast Guard ship is visible in the distance,” the caption accompanying the video read, adding that American reconnaissance aircraft were monitoring the vessel. Flight tracking data shows that 13 Air Force C-17A Globemaster III, a large military transport aircraft, flew from U.S. Air Force bases to the U.K. between Saturday and Monday. As news of the tanker’s seizure broke, flight records showed multiple U.S. military aircraft near the vessel’s last known location. Two U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon aircraft, typically used for maritime patrols, and a KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling tanker were recorded flying off the west and north coasts of Scotland. Two C-130J Hercules tactical transport aircraft and three U-28A Draco special operations aircraft were also recorded flying in the area. The U.K.’s defense ministry said in a statement that Britain had “provided enabling support” to intercept the Marinera, including “pre-planned operational support” and “surveillance support from the air.” It cited assessments that the vessel had been “involved in illegal activity, linked to international terrorism and crime including Hezbollah, and part of the web of rising shadow activity that fuels and finances nefarious activity across the globe.” But the seized tankers are not the only ones threatening to undermine the U.S. blockade. At least three other sanctioned oil tankers that were operating near Venezuela in recent weeks have changed their flags to Russia, according to the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping. The ships — the Malak, now renamed the Sintez; the Dianchi, now the Expander; and the Veronica, now the Galileo — had previously been sailing under the flags of Comoros and Guyana, according to MarineTraffic.

nbc_world,Video shows security forces firing tear gas at protesters as Iran crackdown kills dozens,"Protesters in Iran defied authorities Tuesday, hitting the streets in the capital, Tehran, and smaller cities to chant anti-government slogans amid an ongoing violent crackdown that one human rights group says has left at least 36 dead",https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/iran-security-forces-clash-protesters-death-toll-rises-rcna252550,"Wed, 07 Jan 2026 02:55:37 GMT",2026-01-07 02:55:37,"     Add NBC News to Google       Add NBC News to Google Protesters in Iran defied authorities Tuesday, hitting the streets in the capital, Tehran, and smaller cities to chant anti-government slogans amid an ongoing violent crackdown that one human rights group says has left at least 36 dead. The protests began last week with economic grievances as the Iranian currency, the rial, tanked. They quickly turned political, with demonstrators chanting slogans against the ruling clergy. The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say. HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago — 34 protesters and two members of the security forces — and that more than 2,000 people have been arrested. Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran’s main bazaar Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic. Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979. Another video shows a person using a makeshift flamethrower on security forces in the southern city of Shiraz. President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as a relative moderate, in the past week called for protesters' demands to be heard and said he was asking the interior minister to meet with the leaders of the protest movement. But the head of Iran's judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, warned Wednesday that there would be “no leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic.” Accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country, Ejei was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying there was “no excuse for those coming to the streets for riots and unrest.” But the demonstrations are diffuse and largely leaderless, and Pezeshkian’s efforts at mediation — and the killings and arrests by security forces — have not persuaded the protesters to stay off the streets. “The system has responded to these protests with a combination of conciliatory rhetoric and brute force,” Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions. “The fact that neither has worked indicates that the former falls well short of what the protesters want, and the latter has failed to deter them from expressing it.” Protesters got an unexpected offer of support last week when President Donald Trump warned that the U.S. would intervene if violence against protesters continued, though he did not specify what actions the U.S. might take. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said Friday on X that Trump’s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region “legitimate targets.” Analysts say Trump’s message fed into the conspiracy theories of the most hard-line elements of the government, who were already on high alert for any foreign interference after a devastating 12-day war with Israel last summer, partly joined by the U.S. military, which left the country reeling. The detention of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, a staunch Tehran ally, over the weekend only highlighted the issue for Iranian officials. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the operation to detain Maduro ""a clear example of state terrorism"" in a telephone call with his Venezuelan counterpart Saturday, according to the Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry’s official website . “What the threshold for U.S. intervention would be, or what it might look like, is not entirely clear but the leadership in Tehran is likely worried about the prospect of dealing with not just instability from below but military action from abroad,” Vaez said. Some of the worst violence in recent days took place in the small town of Malekshahi and nearby Ilam in western Iran. The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported that security forces opened fire on a crowd Saturday, killing five people and wounding more than 40 others. In a video posted on the organization’s site, which was verified by NBC News, a crowd disperses quickly as multiple gunshots ring out and a handful of men return to pick up a man bleeding from a head wound. The wounded and dead from Saturday's violence in Malekshahi were taken to the Imam Khomeini hospital in Ilam, where security forces stormed the compound and used batons, tear gas and live fire, according to Hengaw. A video posted on the organization’s site, which was verified by NBC News, shows a member of the security forces shooting into the hospital courtyard where people were gathered behind a gate. The U.S. State Department's Farsi language account on X posted a video of the security forces rushing into the Ilam hospital compound below text that read, ""Hospitals are not battlefields."" The post also called the raid ""a crime."" On Monday, Pezeshkian issued an order for the interior minister to investigate the unrest in Ilam province, according to the semi-official Iranian Students’ News Agency. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, an international affairs think tank in London, said the use of the security forces, the slowing down of the internet and the violence in smaller towns were part of a “crackdown playbook” used by the government to deal with protests. “This is, of course, all part of a more organized effort, after a few lenient first days, to get people off of the streets as soon as possible,” she said.

The protests began last week with economic grievances as the Iranian currency, the rial, tanked. They quickly turned political, with demonstrators chanting slogans against the ruling clergy. The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say. HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago — 34 protesters and two members of the security forces — and that more than 2,000 people have been arrested. Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran’s main bazaar Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic. Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979. Another video shows a person using a makeshift flamethrower on security forces in the southern city of Shiraz. President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as a relative moderate, in the past week called for protesters' demands to be heard and said he was asking the interior minister to meet with the leaders of the protest movement. But the head of Iran's judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, warned Wednesday that there would be “no leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic.” Accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country, Ejei was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying there was “no excuse for those coming to the streets for riots and unrest.” But the demonstrations are diffuse and largely leaderless, and Pezeshkian’s efforts at mediation — and the killings and arrests by security forces — have not persuaded the protesters to stay off the streets. “The system has responded to these protests with a combination of conciliatory rhetoric and brute force,” Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions. “The fact that neither has worked indicates that the former falls well short of what the protesters want, and the latter has failed to deter them from expressing it.” Protesters got an unexpected offer of support last week when President Donald Trump warned that the U.S. would intervene if violence against protesters continued, though he did not specify what actions the U.S. might take.

CARACAS, Venezuela — Days after Venezuela’s capital was rocked by explosions and the country’s leader was seized in a U.S. operation , the streets of this city were eerily quiet. Few people are venturing from their homes, although businesses have begun to reopen and the long lines that had snaked outside the few pharmacies and supermarkets that were operational over the weekend are disappearing. Those trying to get to work using the public bus system seem to be struggling as it seems to be on a skeleton schedule. The more than half a dozen people who spoke to NBC News said that there has been an increased presence of government security forces as well as armed civilian paramilitaries loyal to the government. Officials have called for the arrest of anyone involved in the weekend’s attack . For those who quietly oppose the Maduro government, they hope they’re finally seeing the end of a dark period of their history. For those who supported him, there’s the uncertainty of what will happen to their leader. Daniel, a gardener who commutes from his home on the outskirts of Caracas to the upscale neighborhood of Altamira, said he stayed home on Monday because he was afraid of encountering pro-government groups that are widely reported to be checking people’s cellphones. Like everyone interviewed for this story, Daniel asked not to be fully identified out of fear of reprisal from authorities that are very much still in power. Despite the uncertainty, Daniel said he was hopeful that sooner or later Venezuelans would have a country where they could express themselves freely and choose their own leaders. “I can’t deny that the future makes me anxious, but I do trust that change can happen from now on,” he told NBC News. After an extraordinary weekend — when the country’s authoritarian leader and his wife, Nicolas Maduro and Cilia Flores, were seized by U.S. special forces and American bombs rained down on military facilities, ports and power installations — the regime appears to be holding firm. President Donald Trump has made clear as of now that he supports the leadership of Maduro’s vice president and successor, Delcy Rodriguez, who has said she is willing to work with the United States. Still, intractable issues remain. The government continues to be willing to use intimidation and violence to remain in power and shows few signs of trying to fix an economy that has trapped 90% of the population in poverty despite the country’s vast oil wealth. Hundreds of people are still in prison after they were arrested during protests following the July 2024 election, where there was credible evidence Maduro’s opposition won . On Sunday morning, Josefina and her husband, both 70-year-old retirees, were driving along Boyacá Avenue, a highway that carves an east-to-west path across Caracas alongside Waraira Repano National Park. The road is popular on weekends when families take in the views of nature surrounding the city. What was supposed to have been a relaxing weekend outing turned nerve-wracking when the couple encountered a checkpoint. At first they thought it was “colectivos” — armed civilians who support the Venezuelan government. Instead, a black van carrying the insignia of the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence, which is responsible for stopping espionage and intelligence threats, was parked behind the men. “They were dressed in civilian clothes and were heavily armed,” Josefina said . Josefina and her husband got home fine since they likely are not seen as a threat to a government that is on highest alert. But on Monday, near the National Assembly around the time Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president, 14 journalists and press workers were detained. ​Thirteen journalists have been released and one was deported, according to a local journalists’ group. Some residents said they were afraid of the possibility of another U.S. attack. Rosa, a 47-year-old optometrist who lives and works in eastern Caracas, said that while she was happy about Maduro’s capture, she would never forget the terror she experienced early Saturday. “I would never want to live through something like that again in my life,” she said, describing how at 2 a.m. an explosion woke her up. “The windows of my house shook as if there were an earthquake. It was so strong that my neighbor’s windows cracked.” Germari, 26, a graduate in foreign trade who lives near one of the military bases attacked on Saturday, echoed that sentiment. “My mother, my sister, and I have been sleeping together since that day,” she said. “We haven’t rested because even the sound of cars frightens us. My biggest worry is that it will happen again.” For now, the city remains relatively still as residents of Caracas figure out what comes next amid a range of feelings. A 63-year-old professional who works from home said that this tranquility masks a multitude of fears. “Supposedly the country is calm, but simply it is a tense calm,” she told NBC News via WhatsApp. “And calm for us citizens [is] as long as we limit ourselves to doing our own thing without commenting on anything political and do what we have to do: buy food, medicine, go to work ... and that’s it.” NBC News","A tense calm on the streets of Caracas masks fears and uncertainty for Venezuelans      Add NBC News to Google       Add NBC News to Google This article is by F.

Trump and his team have ramped up hostile suggestions that they want to seize Greenland , a vast Arctic island of just 50,000 people that has mineral and strategic significance. The U.S. attack against Venezuela and capture of President Nicolás Maduro — which the United Nations said undermined international law —  has raised fears that this might not be an empty threat. Follow live coverage here The European leaders were in Paris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and others, according to a White House official. It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Though these negotiations have accelerated since November, the U.S. attack on Venezuela and continued suggestions of seizing Greenland have cast a shadow over the talks, which are being held with the very allies that — under NATO’s principle of collective defense — Trump has suggested attacking. “The Kingdom of Denmark — including Greenland — is part of NATO,” the allies said in a joint statement. “Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,” said the statement, issued by the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark. It added that “the United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally” and through a 1951 defense agreement allowing Washington to build military bases on the vast island. “Greenland belongs to its people,” it said. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.” Outgoing centrist Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., called the statement ""embarrassing for the U.S."" in a post on X . ""Denigrating our Allies serves no purpose and there is NO up side,"" he said. ""It weakens us by diminishing trust between friends, and Russia and China love it. So… stop the stupid 'we want Greenland BS.'"" One of the key elements being discussed in Paris is Ukraine and Europe’s desire for “security guarantees,” which could come in the form of a multinational force being deployed to Ukraine to ensure Russia does not launch further attacks. French President Emmanuel Macron had said Tuesday’s gathering of the so-called coalition of the willing would see the powers “make concrete commitments” to Ukraine’s security as part of any future peace deal with Russia. Kyiv and its allies have consistently said that this would need to be backed by American military power. But Trump has indicated he may instead turn that might against a NATO ally, telling NBC News on Monday that he was “very serious” in his ambitions to take control of Greenland. Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, took this a step further. He told CNN that ""obviously Greenland should be part of the U.S."" because of what he described as the island's geostrategic importance in helping Washington fulfill its role as ""the power of NATO."" ""The real question is, what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?"" he said. ""Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over Greenland,"" Miller added. Any U.S. action against Greenland would be a dramatic and historic escalation, even when set against Trump’s past hostility toward Washington’s erstwhile European allies. Denmark is a NATO partner, and dozens of its troops died fighting in U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many experts believe that U.S. military action to seize the territory would spell the end of the alliance and mark a new nadir for transatlantic ties that are already strained under Trump. “It would de facto mean that NATO was dead because many European nations would simply say, ‘OK, we cannot rely on the Americans anymore,’” said Peter Viggo Jakobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said much the same Monday, telling her country’s TV2 broadcaster that “if the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops.” Even without the building panic over Greenland, it remains a colossal ask to bridge the chasm between Russia’s insistence on its hard-line demands and the fears held by Ukraine and Europe that President Vladimir Putin may use a deal as a launchpad to attack again. Zelenskyy said that a peace deal is “90%” there, albeit suggesting that the final 10% contains the thorniest issues. It is unclear whether Russia will ever accept any form of security guarantee, with Putin wavering little in his demand for Ukraine’s effective surrender.

The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country’s leaders about how much support they really enjoy. Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump’s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region “legitimate targets.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran “violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.” He did not specify what this would mean. Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities. Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to “knock the hell out of” Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program. Saturday’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran’s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as “a clear example of state terrorism.” But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year. “Iranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They’re not mutually exclusive feelings,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview. “And I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn’t willing to reform or change,” Vakil said, Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran’s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say. The country’s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts. President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country’s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems. “If the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don’t look for America or someone else to blame,” Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. “We need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.” The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian’s powers in dealing with the protests. “He is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He’s trying to say it’s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,” Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview. “I don’t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime’s inherent corruption and incapacity,” Milani said. “They want the regime changed.” Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests , including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran. It remains to be seen whether Trump’s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire. “People could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,” said Vakil of Chatham House. “But I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.” Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 — when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested — will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say. “They will have a scorched-earth policy,” Milani from Stanford said.

The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country’s leaders about how much support they really enjoy. Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump’s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region “legitimate targets.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran “violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.” He did not specify what this would mean. Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities. Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to “knock the hell out of” Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program. Saturday’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran’s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as “a clear example of state terrorism.” But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year. “Iranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They’re not mutually exclusive feelings,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview. “And I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn’t willing to reform or change,” Vakil said, Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran’s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say. The country’s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts. President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country’s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems. “If the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don’t look for America or someone else to blame,” Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. “We need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.” The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian’s powers in dealing with the protests. “He is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He’s trying to say it’s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,” Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview. “I don’t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime’s inherent corruption and incapacity,” Milani said. “They want the regime changed.” Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests , including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.

""No, it’s going to take a period of time. We have — we have to nurse the country back to health."" Moreover, he said, the U.S. may subsidize an effort by oil companies to rebuild the country's energy infrastructure — a project he said could take less than 18 months. ""I think we can do it in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money,"" he said. ""A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue."" He also insisted the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela. ""No, we’re not,"" Trump said. ""We’re at war with people that sell drugs. We’re at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country."" In the roughly 20-minute interview, Trump identified a group of U.S. officials — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance — who will help oversee America’s involvement in Venezuela. ""It's a group of all. They have all expertise, different expertise,"" he said. But he had a one-word answer for who is ultimately in charge: “Me.” Trump’s discussion of his vision for Venezuela came just a couple of hours after Maduro was arraigned in New York on a series of charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy. He was seized from a compound in the capital city of Caracas in the wee hours of Saturday morning during a raid by U.S. special forces and law enforcement officials. Maduro pleaded not guilty, saying he remains the leader of his country even as Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in Monday as his successor. Trump said Rodríguez has been cooperating with U.S. officials but insisted there was no communication between her camp and the American side before Maduro's ouster. ""No, that’s not the case,"" he said, adding that a determination will be made soon about whether existing sanctions against Rodríguez will be left in place or lifted. When asked if there was ""any deal with any official in Venezuela to remove"" Maduro, Trump replied, ""Well, yeah, because a lot of people wanted to make a deal, but we decided to do it this way,"" adding that it was without the help of Maduro's inner circle. Trump also declined to say whether he's spoken to Rodríguez yet, but he said that Rubio ""speaks to her fluently in Spanish"" and that their ""relationship has been very strong."" He indicated that the U.S. could launch a second military incursion into Venezuela if Rodríguez stops cooperating with U.S. officials but said he does not believe that will be necessary. Trump also suggested he had initially expected to have to send in American forces again already. ""We’re prepared to do it,"" he said. ""We anticipated doing it, actually."" Trump also denied a Washington Post report that he had dismissed the possibility of Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado running the country because she won the Nobel Peace Prize last year — an award long sought by Trump . ""She should not have won it,"" he said. ""But no, that has nothing to do with my decision."" Having campaigned on an ""America First"" platform and his desire to end wars, rather than start them, Trump has seen some of his political allies question the wisdom of the U.S. entering into a long-term commitment in Venezuela.

Critics in both parties have noted that Trump did not seek a new authorization from Congress to launch Saturday morning's raid, and he said in the interview that he would not need lawmakers to act in order for him to send American troops back in. ""We have good support congressionally,"" he said. ""And Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn't they support us?""

Trump’s longtime threats to seize Denmark’s territory of Greenland have been widely derided in Europe, mocked even, as outlandish talk that could surely never translate into the United States effectively invading a NATO ally. But Trump's willingness and ability to capture Maduro — and his suggestion that Greenland and its own vast natural resources may be next — have raised worries that there may be more to this Arctic ambition. It has triggered the strongest protests yet against Washington’s hostile overtures , including from longtime U.S. allies in Europe. “No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation,” Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post Sunday. “When the president of the United States talks about ‘we need Greenland’ and connects us with Venezuela and military intervention, it’s not just wrong. This is so disrespectful,” he added. “Our country is not an object of superpower rhetoric. We are a people. A land. And democracy. This has to be respected. Especially by close and loyal friends.” Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, was more forthright Monday. “If the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,” she told public broadcaster DR, according to Reuters. “I have made it very clear where the Kingdom of Denmark stands, and Greenland has repeatedly said that it does not want to be part of the United States,” she said. “Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland.” Trump and his team have for months said they want to take over the vast semi-autonomous Danish territory , citing its strategic importance and mineral wealth. After Maduro’s capture, he doubled down on the idea, telling reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, “We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you.” He mocked local efforts to defend the sparsely populated island, saying “they added one more dog sled” that would be no match for the “Russian and Chinese ships” he claimed were “all over the place” around the territory. (That rationale is disputed by experts: Peter Viggo Jakobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told NBC News that these ships ""do not exist.”) Adding to the alarm, Katie Miller, a right-wing podcast host and the wife of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, posted an image of Greenland superimposed with the American flag and the caption ""SOON!"" Though Trump stunned the world by sending aircraft and personnel to grab Maduro in Caracas, intervention in Greenland would arguably carry greater risk of escalation. Denmark’s NATO membership carries with it the implied protection of Article 5 — the promise that an attack on one ally will be treated as an attack on all. However, the U.S. is by far the biggest contributor to NATO and has historically been seen as the ultimate guarantor behind its pledge of mutual self-defense. Germany indicated Monday that European allies would be prepared to step in. “Since Denmark is a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defense,” Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters in Lithuania. “And if there are further requirements to strengthen defense efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance.” European leaders are hesitant to criticize Trump — a man on whom they still rely for much of their military defense, not to mention his ever-looming threat of more tariffs. But many were quick Monday to stress that Greenland’s future is “not for others to decide,” as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. France expressed similar ""solidarity with Denmark."" Others are harshly critical of their delicate approach. “We must make it very clear to the Trump administration that threats to them is unacceptable,” said Ben Wallace, former British defense secretary for the now-opposition Conservative Party. He criticized ""weak government ministers"" for ""saying nothing."" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, meanwhile, cautioned that ""no-one will take seriously a weak and divided Europe: neither enemy nor ally."" Trump has been threatening Greenland for around a year, and last month named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to the territory. Denmark’s military intelligence service has also for the first time classified the U.S. as a security risk. Yet, Trump's capture of Maduro has seemingly focused minds in European governments. “It made them realize that this is not completely impossible,” Jakobsen said. “I still think it’s very unlikely,” he added, calling the idea “absurd.” There’s a “huge difference between launching a special forces operation against a country like Venezuela — which is effectively a pariah and is beset with domestic problems — and then doing the same thing in a NATO country that is in an alliance with the U.S.,” he said. The U.S. can already request additional military bases on Greenland’s frozen soil, and “there’s nothing to prevent the U.S. from making minerals deals either,” Jakobsen added. “So in that respect, Trump is creating a problem that does not exist,” he said. “Does that mean that I’m then going to rule it out completely?

A leader deposed by a superpower that views them as illegitimate. While some are drawing parallels between the United States’ dramatic action in Venezuela and China’s ambitions for Taiwan , experts say Beijing is less concerned about the self-ruled island’s sovereignty and instead views the attack as an opportunity to undermine America’s global leadership. As the Trump administration withdraws from global institutions and upends long-standing norms, Beijing has sought to cast itself as the true champion of the rules-based international order. Chinese state media commentaries on the Venezuela attack argue that the U.S. is now one of the biggest threats to that order , and that its actions have undermined its credibility in Latin America. “This is a country which just behaved like a hegemon, right?” said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. “How can you trust a country that would deal with its weak neighbors this way?” China has strongly condemned the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , saying it violated international law and threatens peace and security in Latin America. It said the U.S. should immediately release Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are set to appear Monday in a New York court on drug trafficking and other charges. On Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping appeared to refer to the  attack on one of his country’s main South American allies, saying the world was experiencing turbulence and that “unilateral bullying seriously impacts the international order.” “All countries should respect the development path independently chosen by other peoples, abide by international law and the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and major countries should take the lead,” he said during a meeting in Beijing with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, without mentioning the U.S. by name. His comments came a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said no country “can play the role of world policeman, nor do we agree that any country can claim itself to be an international judge.” China has long served as an economic lifeline for the heavily sanctioned Venezuela, accounting for the majority of its crude oil exports. It has expressed support for Venezuela in recent months amid President Donald Trump ’s military buildup, though it has no security commitments to the country and experts say it has avoided more concrete action in part to preserve the U.S.-China trade truce. Maduro was seized hours after he met in Caracas with Qiu Xiaoqi, Beijing’s special envoy for Latin American affairs, in his last publicly reported official meeting. It is unclear whether Qiu and the rest of his delegation are still in Venezuela. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that there were “no reports of Chinese personnel in Venezuela being affected by U.S. airstrikes.” In a caption accompanying photos and videos posted on his Instagram account , Maduro described the meeting as “a fraternal encounter that reaffirms the strong ties of brotherhood and friendship between China and Venezuela.” China, which is already South America’s top trading partner, is seeking to expand its influence in the region, even as Trump has put it at the center of his national security agenda. Though Beijing has emphasized economic ties and nonintervention in its approach to Latin America, there was a greater focus on military and law enforcement cooperation in the policy paper it released last month. “All the countries in the region have more or less healthy relations with China,” said Bárbara Fernández Melleda, an assistant professor of Latin American studies at the University of Hong Kong. “And if the United States becomes hostile against China through Latin American countries, that’s a new scenario.” The U.S. attack on Venezuela, where Chinese companies have invested billions, has raised alarm in China, Wu said. Latin American countries may feel pressured “to be more cautious in dealing with China on the economic front in the future,” he told NBC News in an interview. “And also for the Chinese business community, they see not just uncertainty but rising risk from this region.” 'Two different issues' The U.S. attack on Venezuela has also raised fears that it could embolden China to move against Taiwan, the self-ruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory and has vowed to bring under its control, by force if necessary. And for some users on China’s heavily censored social media, Trump’s assertion that the U.S. was “in charge” after Maduro was captured was a source of inspiration. “The arrest of the Venezuelan president set a good example for us. Taiwan’s William Lai must be trembling in fear now!” read one comment on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, referring to Lai Ching-te , the president of Taiwan. But Venezuela and Taiwan are “two different issues,” according to Wu at Fudan University. “Venezuela is an independent sovereign state, and Taiwan is part of China,” he said, adding that China prefers “a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue.” The events in Venezuela will not “dramatically alter Beijing’s calculus on Taiwan,” said Ryan Hass, director of Brookings’ John L. Thornton China Center, adding that China will focus on protecting its interests in Latin America. “Privately,” he said on X , “I expect Beijing will emphasize to Washington it expects to be given the same latitude for great power exemptions to international law that the U.S. takes for itself” — particularly in the South China Sea , a strategically vital shipping route that China claims virtually in its entirety.      Add NBC News to Google The Taiwanese government has yet to comment publicly on Maduro’s capture. The island has been under growing pressure from Beijing, which encircled it last week in a large-scale military exercise that simulated a blockade. The live-fire drills followed the announcement of an $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan by the U.S., the island’s biggest weapons supplier. The U.S. strike in Venezuela could slow down China’s timetable for an attack on Taiwan, “but may give ammunition to U.S. skeptics” on the island who worry that Washington won’t come to its defense, said Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub who is based in Taiwan's capital, Taipei. The U.S. military’s ability to carry out a Maduro-style “decapitation strike,” especially against Venezuela’s largely Chinese defense systems, could make Beijing think twice about testing its military against Washington’s, Sung said via a messaging app. But the strike also reinforces the view that the U.S. is “preoccupied with the Western Hemisphere, and skeptics will wonder in whose sphere of influence Taiwan falls within this Monroe Doctrine 2.0,” he said, referring to Trump’s twist on the 19th-century U.S. foreign policy. Others say China has refrained from attacking Taiwan not because it lacks global permission, but because it is simply not ready. “China has never lacked hostile intent toward Taiwan; what it truly lacks is the ability to carry it out,” Wang Ting-yu, a senior lawmaker from Taiwan’s governing Democratic Progressive Party, said Sunday in a post on Facebook. “China is not the United States, and Taiwan is certainly not Venezuela.

A leader deposed by a superpower that views them as illegitimate. While some are drawing parallels between the United States’ dramatic action in Venezuela and China’s ambitions for Taiwan , experts say Beijing is less concerned about the self-ruled island’s sovereignty and instead views the attack as an opportunity to undermine America’s global leadership. As the Trump administration withdraws from global institutions and upends long-standing norms, Beijing has sought to cast itself as the true champion of the rules-based international order. Chinese state media commentaries on the Venezuela attack argue that the U.S. is now one of the biggest threats to that order , and that its actions have undermined its credibility in Latin America. “This is a country which just behaved like a hegemon, right?” said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. “How can you trust a country that would deal with its weak neighbors this way?” China has strongly condemned the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , saying it violated international law and threatens peace and security in Latin America. It said the U.S. should immediately release Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are set to appear Monday in a New York court on drug trafficking and other charges. On Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping appeared to refer to the  attack on one of his country’s main South American allies, saying the world was experiencing turbulence and that “unilateral bullying seriously impacts the international order.” “All countries should respect the development path independently chosen by other peoples, abide by international law and the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and major countries should take the lead,” he said during a meeting in Beijing with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, without mentioning the U.S. by name. His comments came a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said no country “can play the role of world policeman, nor do we agree that any country can claim itself to be an international judge.” China has long served as an economic lifeline for the heavily sanctioned Venezuela, accounting for the majority of its crude oil exports. It has expressed support for Venezuela in recent months amid President Donald Trump ’s military buildup, though it has no security commitments to the country and experts say it has avoided more concrete action in part to preserve the U.S.-China trade truce. Maduro was seized hours after he met in Caracas with Qiu Xiaoqi, Beijing’s special envoy for Latin American affairs, in his last publicly reported official meeting. It is unclear whether Qiu and the rest of his delegation are still in Venezuela. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that there were “no reports of Chinese personnel in Venezuela being affected by U.S. airstrikes.” In a caption accompanying photos and videos posted on his Instagram account , Maduro described the meeting as “a fraternal encounter that reaffirms the strong ties of brotherhood and friendship between China and Venezuela.” China, which is already South America’s top trading partner, is seeking to expand its influence in the region, even as Trump has put it at the center of his national security agenda. Though Beijing has emphasized economic ties and nonintervention in its approach to Latin America, there was a greater focus on military and law enforcement cooperation in the policy paper it released last month. “All the countries in the region have more or less healthy relations with China,” said Bárbara Fernández Melleda, an assistant professor of Latin American studies at the University of Hong Kong. “And if the United States becomes hostile against China through Latin American countries, that’s a new scenario.” The U.S. attack on Venezuela, where Chinese companies have invested billions, has raised alarm in China, Wu said. Latin American countries may feel pressured “to be more cautious in dealing with China on the economic front in the future,” he told NBC News in an interview. “And also for the Chinese business community, they see not just uncertainty but rising risk from this region.” 'Two different issues' The U.S. attack on Venezuela has also raised fears that it could embolden China to move against Taiwan, the self-ruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory and has vowed to bring under its control, by force if necessary. And for some users on China’s heavily censored social media, Trump’s assertion that the U.S. was “in charge” after Maduro was captured was a source of inspiration. “The arrest of the Venezuelan president set a good example for us. Taiwan’s William Lai must be trembling in fear now!” read one comment on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, referring to Lai Ching-te , the president of Taiwan. But Venezuela and Taiwan are “two different issues,” according to Wu at Fudan University. “Venezuela is an independent sovereign state, and Taiwan is part of China,” he said, adding that China prefers “a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue.” The events in Venezuela will not “dramatically alter Beijing’s calculus on Taiwan,” said Ryan Hass, director of Brookings’ John L. Thornton China Center, adding that China will focus on protecting its interests in Latin America. “Privately,” he said on X , “I expect Beijing will emphasize to Washington it expects to be given the same latitude for great power exemptions to international law that the U.S. takes for itself” — particularly in the South China Sea , a strategically vital shipping route that China claims virtually in its entirety.      Add NBC News to Google The Taiwanese government has yet to comment publicly on Maduro’s capture. The island has been under growing pressure from Beijing, which encircled it last week in a large-scale military exercise that simulated a blockade. The live-fire drills followed the announcement of an $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan by the U.S., the island’s biggest weapons supplier. The U.S. strike in Venezuela could slow down China’s timetable for an attack on Taiwan, “but may give ammunition to U.S. skeptics” on the island who worry that Washington won’t come to its defense, said Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub who is based in Taiwan's capital, Taipei.

The United States stunned the world on Saturday by launching military strikes in Venezuela and seizing President Nicolás Maduro, swiftly ending his 13-year rule in an operation the Trump administration framed as a demonstration of American power, as President Donald Trump boasted that the U.S. possessed “capabilities and skills our enemies can scarcely imagine.” America’s adversaries heard him loudest. Follow live updates Russia and China swiftly condemned the strikes and called for the release of Maduro, who has been brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges. Iran and Cuba denounced what they called a violation of international law, their objections carrying an edge of unease that they, too, could find themselves in Washington’s sights . Even major European allies, more cautious and measured in tone, carefully signaled concern about the operation’s legality while largely aligning with the U.S. on policy. Taken together, these responses suggest the revival of old fears of American interventionism, prompting allies and adversaries alike to ponder where Washington might act next. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise to ""demolish foreign drug cartels"" by going after Maduro. She said on X that the operation would ""keep our citizens safe"" in keeping with Trump's “America First” agenda. For Tehran, the fall of a close ally comes as it grapples with internal unrest of its own , just a day after Trump warned Iran it could face U.S. action if protesters were harmed. “The American military attack on Venezuela is a clear violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and the fundamental rules of international law,” it said in a statement published on Telegram by Iran’s semiofficial news agency. In Havana, Cuba’s leadership labeled the attack “state terrorism,” acutely aware that both Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have openly questioned how long the Cuban government itself should remain untouched. Rubio’s “primary interest is in Cuba, not in Venezuela,” said Michael Paarlberg, a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy, noting that Rubio sees Venezuela “as the chief patron of the Cuban regime.” Asked Sunday during an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press” whether the Trump administration’s next target is the Cuban government, Rubio said, “The Cuban government is a huge problem.” He said: “I’m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard. But I don’t think it’s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.”      Add NBC News to Google “We are at war against drug trafficking organizations, it's not a war against Venezuela,” Rubio said of the intervention. “We are enforcing American laws with regards to oil sanctions.” While past U.S. regime-change efforts in Cuba have failed, dating back decades, Paarlberg told NBC News the Cuban government was still likely to be “worried about something like a direct parallel.” The United States’ traditional adversaries were not alone in their condemnation, with several left-leaning governments in Latin America warning the move risked destabilizing the region. Brazil said the U.S. had crossed an “unacceptable line,” warning the attack set an “extremely dangerous precedent for the international community.” Other democratic leaders in the region, including Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum and Chile’s Gabriel Boric, joined in denouncing the U.S. intervention. Legal experts also questioned the operation’s legality . The use of military force to remove Venezuela’s president is effectively a “kidnapping” and violates core principles of the United Nations Charter, said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor at Notre Dame Law School. “If you detain someone unlawfully, if you take someone into your custody and you do not have the legal right to do that, then what else would you call it?” she told NBC News. “The U.N. Charter makes it very clear that there are very few times when a country has the right to carry out military force on the territory of another country,” she added. “And it never has the right to do that in order to bring an individual out to stand trial before their courts.” Many European allies struck a careful balance, nodding to international law but without dissent in an effort to avoid upsetting the U.S. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country would “shed no tears” about the end of Maduro’s regime before reiterating his “support for international law,” without saying what that support entails. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the operation “complex,” and said his country “will take our time,” to evaluate it, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she supported a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and that “any solution must respect international law and the U.N. Charter.” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the military operation in Venezuela “contravenes the principle of non-use of force, which underpins international law,” while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said it violated international law. But as reactions to the Venezuela strike fell largely along predictable lines, the precedent it sets has left others wondering how vulnerable they might be, said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London. “European countries were counting on the U.S. and certain types of U.S. behavior that perhaps they can’t do anymore,” he said, noting that Denmark had been careful in its response because “they know that Greenland is in the firing line.” Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of buying or taking Greenland , treating the Danish territory as a strategic asset for the U.S. in the Arctic. Denmark’s ambassador to Washington, Jesper Møller Sørensen, on Saturday shared what he said was a “friendly reminder” on X that “we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” pushing back at Trump-aligned figures who had raised the issue in the wake of the Venezuela strike. Many of the reactions to the Venezuela strike, Hellyer noted, “have very little to do with Maduro and have everything to do with, you know, lining up with the U.S. on a particular issue.” Europe, he said, was “expressing support for international law, but without wanting to be identified as opposing the U.S.,” raising the question: “What’s the point of invoking a system that isn’t backed by the strongest power in the world?” But recent history shows that even as the rules-based order struggles, the U.S. has frequently acted unilaterally, with the Venezuela strike reflecting enduring patterns of intervention in Latin America, according to retired Col. Gregory A. Daddis. “In many ways, U.S. actions in Venezuela follow a long history of American interventionism in the Western Hemisphere,” he said, “where we have argued that the Western Hemisphere, in its entirety, falls within our jurisdiction to protect U.S. interests.” Freddie Clayton is a freelance journalist based in London.","U.S. allies and foes fear Maduro's capture sets precedent for more American intervention      Add NBC News to Google       Add NBC News to Google By capturing Venezuela’s president , Washington sent shock waves felt far beyond Caracas.

Rubio’s “primary interest is in Cuba, not in Venezuela,” said Michael Paarlberg, a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy, noting that Rubio sees Venezuela “as the chief patron of the Cuban regime.” Asked Sunday during an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press” whether the Trump administration’s next target is the Cuban government, Rubio said, “The Cuban government is a huge problem.” He said: “I’m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard. But I don’t think it’s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.”      Add NBC News to Google “We are at war against drug trafficking organizations, it's not a war against Venezuela,” Rubio said of the intervention. “We are enforcing American laws with regards to oil sanctions.” While past U.S. regime-change efforts in Cuba have failed, dating back decades, Paarlberg told NBC News the Cuban government was still likely to be “worried about something like a direct parallel.” The United States’ traditional adversaries were not alone in their condemnation, with several left-leaning governments in Latin America warning the move risked destabilizing the region. Brazil said the U.S. had crossed an “unacceptable line,” warning the attack set an “extremely dangerous precedent for the international community.” Other democratic leaders in the region, including Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum and Chile’s Gabriel Boric, joined in denouncing the U.S. intervention. Legal experts also questioned the operation’s legality . The use of military force to remove Venezuela’s president is effectively a “kidnapping” and violates core principles of the United Nations Charter, said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor at Notre Dame Law School. “If you detain someone unlawfully, if you take someone into your custody and you do not have the legal right to do that, then what else would you call it?” she told NBC News. “The U.N. Charter makes it very clear that there are very few times when a country has the right to carry out military force on the territory of another country,” she added. “And it never has the right to do that in order to bring an individual out to stand trial before their courts.” Many European allies struck a careful balance, nodding to international law but without dissent in an effort to avoid upsetting the U.S. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country would “shed no tears” about the end of Maduro’s regime before reiterating his “support for international law,” without saying what that support entails. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the operation “complex,” and said his country “will take our time,” to evaluate it, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she supported a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and that “any solution must respect international law and the U.N. Charter.” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the military operation in Venezuela “contravenes the principle of non-use of force, which underpins international law,” while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said it violated international law. But as reactions to the Venezuela strike fell largely along predictable lines, the precedent it sets has left others wondering how vulnerable they might be, said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London. “European countries were counting on the U.S. and certain types of U.S. behavior that perhaps they can’t do anymore,” he said, noting that Denmark had been careful in its response because “they know that Greenland is in the firing line.” Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of buying or taking Greenland , treating the Danish territory as a strategic asset for the U.S. in the Arctic. Denmark’s ambassador to Washington, Jesper Møller Sørensen, on Saturday shared what he said was a “friendly reminder” on X that “we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” pushing back at Trump-aligned figures who had raised the issue in the wake of the Venezuela strike. Many of the reactions to the Venezuela strike, Hellyer noted, “have very little to do with Maduro and have everything to do with, you know, lining up with the U.S. on a particular issue.” Europe, he said, was “expressing support for international law, but without wanting to be identified as opposing the U.S.,” raising the question: “What’s the point of invoking a system that isn’t backed by the strongest power in the world?” But recent history shows that even as the rules-based order struggles, the U.S. has frequently acted unilaterally, with the Venezuela strike reflecting enduring patterns of intervention in Latin America, according to retired Col. Gregory A. Daddis. “In many ways, U.S. actions in Venezuela follow a long history of American interventionism in the Western Hemisphere,” he said, “where we have argued that the Western Hemisphere, in its entirety, falls within our jurisdiction to protect U.S. interests.” Freddie Clayton is a freelance journalist based in London.",Security,United States,POSITIVE,0.9896401166915894

The protests erupted Sunday in the capital, Tehran, with crowds largely chanting about economic grievances after the country's currency hit a record low against the dollar as prices soar.

Ali Larijani, a former Parliament speaker who serves as the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, alleged without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. Fatalities were reported Thursday among both protesters and security forces. Gunshots can be heard in several videos of protests that have been posted online since Wednesday. The semiofficial Fars news agency reported Thursday that three people were killed and 17 were injured in what it characterized as an attack on a police station in the city of Azna in Lorestan province in western Iran. One video posted online and geolocated by NBC News which circulated Thursday shows two cars on fire in front of a police station in Azna with a nearby crowd cheering as multiple gunshots ring out. In a separate video posted online and geolocated by NBC News which circulated Thursday, a large crowd in the city of Marvdasht in Fars province in southern Iran is seen walking toward a group of security forces while chanting “Shameless!” The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights named three men it said were protesters killed in Azna, one man killed by security forces in Marvdasht, two men killed by security forces in Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province in central Iran and one man killed by security forces in Fuladshahr in Isfahan province. Hengaw also named Amirhesam Khodayari Fard as a protester who was killed by security forces in the city of Kuhdasht in Lorestan province in western Iran on Wednesday. The semiofficial Tasnim news agency said Khodayari Fard was a member of the Basij militia, which is overseen by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who it said was killed in a clash with protesters. NBC News could not independently determine which version of events is accurate. The demonstrations appeared to be the largest in the Islamic Republic since the Woman, Life, Freedom protests in 2022 and 2023, which posed a serious challenge to authorities and only dwindled after a harsh crackdown from security forces that led to the death of some 500 people and the arrest of thousands. “I think the regime is really cornered in the sense that it cannot address any of the grievances and yet it cannot tolerate people protesting,” Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group, told NBC News in a telephone interview. “So violence has always been their only tool,” Ghaemi said.

This created a four-day break, including the traditional Iranian weekend and a religious holiday for the birthday of Imam Ali on Saturday. Security forces will likely be out in large numbers Saturday, which is also the anniversary of top commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani's killing in a U.S. drone strike in 2020.

Fadel Shaker handed himself over to the country’s military intelligence service in early October, 12 years after going on the run and hiding in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh near the port city of Sidon. Shaker made his first appearance at Beirut’s Military Tribunal Thursday and was questioned over cases including funding armed groups, statements critical of the army that he allegedly made to an Arabic-language newspaper, and whether he played a role in 2013 clashes in south Lebanon that killed 18 soldiers, five judicial officials said. Shaker said during his trial that he only got close to radical Sunni Muslim cleric Ahmed al-Assir after receiving threats from the militant Hezbollah group and supporters of ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad .

Shaker also said that there were disagreements between him and al-Assir before the 2013 clashes broke out in Sidon. Shaker had been on the run since the bloody street clashes between Sunni Muslim militants loyal to al-Assir and the Lebanese army in June 2013. He was tried in absentia and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2020 for providing support to a “terrorist group.” He is on trial again because authorities dropped the sentences he received previously after his surrender.

The demonstrators gathered outside the U.S Embassy in Pretoria with placards condemning Trump’s administration and alleged U.S. intentions to take over Venezuela’s oil reserves. Some of the placards read “Hands Off Venezuela”, “Free President Maduro Now” and “End American Imperialism."" “They want to take this resource (oil reserves) directly under their control, and Donald Trump has not hidden it to the world. He has pronounced it with his own mouth,” the party's secretary general Solly Mapaila told protesters. Some pro-Palestine protesters also joined the demonstration to pledge their solidarity and condemn the actions of the U.S. in Venezuela. Sarah Mukwevho, one of the protesters, said the U.S actions in Venezuela showed that similar events could happen in other countries. “Today it is Venezuela and Maduro, tomorrow it can be any other smaller country that the U.S. is not happy with. There are international platforms for the U.S to raise its grievances instead of the actions we have seen in Venezuela,” said Mukwevho. The protests follow the South African government’s condemnation of Maduro’s capture and calls for the United Nations to intervene. South Africa has had tense relations with the U.S. in recent times, with diplomatic rows over Trump’s accusations that South Africa was allowing a “white genocide” against the minority white Afrikaner community in the country. “It is our commitment to international law and the United Nations charter that informs our deep concern at the actions of the United States in Venezuela, which has undermined the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a UN member state called Venezuela,"" South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said this week. “We reject utterly the actions that the United States and stand with the people of Venezuela and we demand the release of President Majuro and his wife as well,” he added. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","Protesters in South Africa condemn US intervention in Venezuela, call for Maduro's release Protesters have gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in South Africa to oppose U.S. intervention in Venezuela and the capture of former president Nicolas Maduro PRETORIA -- 1.

In exchange, Russian basketball player Daniil Kasatkin, jailed in France and whose extradition was demanded by the United States, was released and returned to Russia on Thursday, Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, said in a statement. Russian state news agency Tass released what it said was FSB footage showing Vinatier in a black track suit and winter jacket being informed about his release, to which he said “Thank you” in Russian, being driven in a car and boarding a plane after Kasatkin descended from it. It wasn't immediately clear when the video was filmed. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday afternoon that “our fellow citizen Laurent Vinatier is free and back in France"" in a post on X, expressing “relief” and “gratitude” towards diplomatic staff for their efforts. Vinatier was arrested in Moscow in June 2024 . Russian authorities accused him of failing to register as a “foreign agent” while collecting information about Russia’s “military and military-technical activities” that could be used to the detriment of national security. A court convicted him and sentenced him to a three-year prison term. Last year, Vinatier was also charged with espionage, according to the FSB — a criminal offense punishable by between 10 and 20 years in prison in Russia. The scholar has been pardoned by Russian President Vladimir Putin, the security agency said. Putin has promised to look into Vinatier's case after a French journalist asked him during his annual news conference on Dec. 19 whether Vinatier’s family could hope for a presidential pardon or his release in a prisoner exchange. The Russian president said at the time that he knew “nothing” about it. Several days later, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia had made “an offer to the French” about Vinatier. Vinatier is an adviser for the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization, which said in June 2024 that it was doing “everything possible to assist” him. The charges that he was convicted on relate to a law that requires anyone collecting information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent.

In recent years, Russia has arrested a number of foreigners — mainly Americans — on various criminal charges and then released them in prisoner swaps with the United States and other Western nations. The largest exchange since the Cold War took place in August 2024, when Moscow freed journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva , fellow American Paul Whelan , and Russian dissidents in a multinational deal that set two dozen people free .

But in reality, they say, he ran online gambling sites, scams and other illegal businesses from a sprawling headquarters along the Cambodian coast. On Thursday, Chen was in custody in China, at the center of what authorities at the Chinese Ministry of Public Security said was a “major achievement” in law enforcement cooperation between them and the Cambodian government. The ministry said that Chen was in its custody and that it soon would issue arrest warrants for key players in his network. Chinese police marched Chen from a China Southern flight with a cloth cover on his head and his hands chained. They pulled off the black cloth, showing his clean-shaven face after he reached the ground, in a video shared by China's Ministry of Public Security's criminal investigations division. Chen was the founder of Prince Holding Group, according to an indictment from U.S. prosecutors. Experts in transnational crime had called him one of the biggest operators of online scamming in Cambodia. He has publicly denied any allegations of wrongdoing. Publicly, Chen Zhi was a respected businessman in Cambodia. He had built up “at least a facade of legitimate businesses that are well connected to the government,” said Mark Taylor, who formerly worked on human trafficking issues in Cambodia for the nonprofit Winrock International. Much of the public connection was in the realm of philanthropy — in particular creating a charity known as the Prince Foundation. During the pandemic, Chen donated $3 million to Cambodia to help purchase COVID-19 vaccines. “I would like to express my deepest appreciation for your kindness,” then Prime Minister Hun Sen wrote, according to a published letter in the Khmer Times. ""May Buddha bless you, your family and your colleagues with the five fortunes!"" Chen held the title of personal adviser to Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father, Hun Sen. Chen also had the honorary title of “neak oknha,"" a moniker reserved for a select few in the country. Chen had also sponsored scholarships, working with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports in a $2 million scholarship program. More uniquely, he's also the founder of Prince Horology, where students on scholarships are taught the art of Swiss-style watchmaking, a benchmark for luxury watches. Chen comes from a county called Lianjiang in southeastern China's Fujian province, according to Jiemian, a Chinese state media outlet. He had previously worked managing an internet cafe when he was starting out. His rise in Cambodia was meteoric. Chen had said that he started with a loan from an uncle in the real estate business. He founded Prince Group in 2015, and the group built up Sihanoukville from a sleepy Cambodian beach town into a larger community that came to be known as a gambling and scam hub, according to Radio Free Asia . But Chen's Prince Group has long been on the radar of authorities both in the U.S. and in China for their alleged illegal activities. Court documents in China show Prince Group is mentioned in at least a dozen judgments, mostly concerned with money laundering and online gambling. Gambling is outlawed in mainland China and allowed only in Macau, a special administrative region. Prosecutors in the western Chinese province of Sichuan sentenced 45 people to jail in a case for setting up illegal online gambling, where they said Chen had worked with Prince Group to set up an online gambling business targeting Chinese nationals as early as 2016. The group set up subsidiary companies in Cambodia's Sihanoukville, Phnom Penh and Chrey Thum, according to the statement from Wangcang County court. There are also trace mentions of Prince Group's links to digital scams. In a major case prosecuted in 2020, police in Anhui province busted a fraud cause involving about 30 million Chinese yuan ($4.3 million) traced to scam compounds operating in Cambodia. According to the court judgment, one man involved in the case had been hired as a security guard for a scam building located in Phnom Penh. Before starting their jobs, they went to register themselves at the Prince Holding Group office, he told the court. In the United States, federal prosecutors in October unsealed an indictment against Chen for defrauding Americans and victims across the world of billions. By this time, he held passports from China, Cambodia, Vanuatu, Cyprus and St. Lucia, according to the indictment. Chen also personally managed the scam compounds and maintained records that tracked the profits from “pig butchering” scams, the Chinese term for the illegal practice, the prosecutors said.

The agreement aimed to resolve discrepancies between the left-wing government and church authorities over the question of reparations for abuse victims in the once staunchly Catholic country, which has secularized in recent decades. The Spanish Episcopal Conference, run by the bishops, said in a statement that the new agreement will allow victims who don’t want to seek help directly from the church to turn to the government and the state’s ombudsman, who has taken a lead role in shedding light on abuse. Spain’s Justice Minister Félix Bolaños said in a press conference in Madrid that “hundreds” of victims whose aggressors had passed away or were now very old could finally receive recognition of the abuse and receive economic reparations paid by the church. “Today, we have paid a debt to the victims,” Bolaños said. “It is true that the State has acted late, but we are acting now. Yesterday, the victims couldn’t do anything because these crimes had proscribed.” Only in the past decade has Spain begun to face the question of sexual abuse by the priesthood and other church members, mainly thanks to the initial reporting by newspaper El País. In 2023, Spain’s ombudsman delivered a damning 800-page report that investigated 487 known cases of sexual abuse and included a survey that calculated the number of possible victims could reach the hundreds of thousands. Spain’s bishops strongly refuted that estimate by the ombudsman, saying its own investigation had uncovered 728 sexual abusers within the church since 1945. It said that most of the crimes had occurred before 1990 and that 60% of the aggressors were now dead. In 2024, the government announced its intention to force the church to compensate victims . That was followed a few months later by the bishops saying they were creating a special committee to hear from victims, assess their claims and ensure their “economic, spiritual and psychological” reparation. But victims' groups were critical of the bishops' plan since it relied on them approaching the church and had no outside oversight. On Thursday, Archbishop Luis Argüello, the president of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, acknowledged that some victims did not feel comfortable approaching the church offices. Now, victims can turn to the government instead. Under the new agreement, victims can approach Spain's Justice Ministry with their initial petition. The ministry will pass it on to the ombudsman, who will study it and propose a compensation package that the church’s committee will then assess. If no agreement can be reached with the church and the victim, the case will go to a joint committee with representatives of the church, the ombudsman's office and victims' associations. If that committee can’t agree, the ombudsman's decision will stand, Bolaños said. The window for filing claims will be open for one year. After that, the agreement can be extended for an additional year if needed, according to Bolaños. In addition to victims' groups and the Spanish bishops, Bolaños thanked the work of late Pope Francis and Pope Leo XIV in uncovering abuse in the church . Argüello said the church had already paid out 2 million euros ($2.3 million) in compensation after taking up petitions by more than a hundred victims since its special committee opened in 2024. Payments to victims will be free of taxes in the new deal. Only a handful of countries have had government-initiated or parliamentary inquiries into clergy sex abuse, although some independent groups have carried out their own investigations. The issue of compensating victims of abuse has long vexed the church, with wide disparities in programs and payouts around the world. In the United States, where the abuse scandal erupted in 2002, litigation, settlements and abuse compensation programs have cost the church billions of dollars and led several dioceses to seek bankruptcy protection. Elsewhere, church-run compensation programs have awarded smaller amounts to victims and paired financial reparations with services offering therapy and spiritual assistance. The French church, for example, paid out an average of about 35,000 euros ($41,000) to each of the 358 victims whose claims were received in 2023. Compensation awards were approved in 2024 for another 489 people, 88 of whom were given the maximum 60,000 euro ($70,000) claim, the church reported. The Vatican’s child protection advisory board said in its report last year that the Catholic Church had a moral obligation to help victims heal, and that financial reparations for the abused, and tougher sanctions for the abusers and their enablers were essential remedies. ___ AP writer Nicole Winfield contributed to this report from Rome. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","Bishops and Spanish government agree on a plan to compensate sexual abuse victims Spain’s government and the country’s Catholic bishops have agreed to a joint plan to compensate victims of sexual abuse by clergy members who have died or whose possible crimes have been proscribed BARCELONA, Spain -- Spain's government and the country's Catholic bishops agreed Thursday to a joint plan to compensate victims of sexual abuse by clergy members who have died or whose possible crimes have been proscribed.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said on Wednesday a meeting about Greenland would happen next week , without giving details about timing, location or participants. “I’m not here to talk about Denmark or military intervention. I’ll be meeting with them next week, we’ll have those conversations with them then,” Rubio told reporters on Capitol Hill. Greenland's government has told Danish public broadcaster DR that Greenland will participate in the meeting between Denmark and the U.S. announced by Rubio. “Nothing about Greenland without Greenland. Of course we will be there. We are the ones who requested the meeting,” Greenland’s Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt told DR. The island of Greenland, 80% of which lies above the Arctic Circle, is home to about 56,000 mostly Inuit people. U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on Wednesday that Denmark “obviously” had not done a proper job in securing Greenland and that Trump “is willing to go as far as he has to” to defend American interests in the Arctic. In an interview with Fox News, Vance repeated Trump's claim that Greenland is crucial to both the U.S. and the world's national security because ""the entire missile defense infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland.” He said the fact that Denmark has been a faithful military ally of the U.S. during World War Two and the more recent “war on terrorism” did not necessarily mean they were doing enough to secure Greenland today. “Just because you did something smart 25 years ago doesn’t mean you can’t do something dumb now,” Vance said, adding that Trump ""is saying very clearly, ‘you are not doing a good job with respect to Greenland.’” Vance's comments came after Rubio told a select group of U.S. lawmakers that it was the Republican administration’s intention to eventually purchase Greenland, as opposed to using military force. “Greenland belongs to its people,"" Antonio Costa, the President of the European Council, said on Wednesday. “Nothing can be decided about Denmark and about Greenland without Denmark, or without Greenland. They have the full solid support and solidarity of the European Union.” The leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the U.K. joined Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Tuesday in defending Greenland’s sovereignty in the wake of Trump’s comments about Greenland, which is part of the NATO military alliance. After Vance’s visit to Greenland last year, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen published a video detailing the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the U.S.. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, Rasmussen said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today. The base supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO. The 1951 agreement “offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,” Rasmussen said. “If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.” Last year, Denmark’s parliament approved a bill to allow U.S. military bases on Danish soil. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where U.S. troops had broad access to Danish air bases in the Scandinavian country. Denmark is moving to strengthen its military presence around Greenland and in the wider North Atlantic. Last year, the government announced a 14.6 billion-kroner ($2.3 billion) agreement with parties including the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands, another self-governing territory of Denmark, to “improve capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region.” The plan includes three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity. Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command, headquartered in Nuuk, is tasked with the “surveillance, assertion of sovereignty and military defense of Greenland and the Faroe Islands,” according to its website. It has smaller satellite stations across the island. The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, an elite Danish naval unit that conducts long-range reconnaissance and enforces Danish sovereignty in the Arctic wilderness, is also stationed in Greenland. ___ Seung Min Kim inWashington contributed reporting. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","Denmark sees talks with US as a chance for 'dialogue that is needed' over Greenland Denmark has welcomed a meeting with the U.S. next week to discuss the Trump administration's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland Denmark has welcomed a meeting with the U.S. next week to discuss President Donald Trump’s renewed call for the strategic, mineral-rich Arctic island of Greenland to come under American control . “This is the dialogue that is needed, as requested by the government together with the Greenlandic government,” Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR on Thursday.

Speaking upon arrival in Beirut, Abbas Araghchi told reporters that Iran is also ready for negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear program as long as the talks are based on mutual respect rather than “dictation” by Washington. Araghchi’s comments came as many fear that close U.S. ally Israel will target Iran again as it did during the 12-day war it launched against Tehran in June. Israel killed a slew of top military officials and nuclear scientists, and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. “America and Israel have tested their attack on Iran and this attack and strategy faced extreme failure,” the Iranian official said in Beirut at the start of a two-day visit to Lebanon. “If they repeat it, they will face the same results.” “We are ready for any choice. We don’t desire a war but we are ready for it,” Araghchi said. In February, U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed a “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran in an effort to block its development of nuclear weapons. The campaign included U.S. led strikes on three critical Iranian enrichment facilities in June. Araghchi said Tehran is ready for “negotiations but I say that the negotiations should be based on mutual respect and mutual interests.” “We believe that once the Americans reach the outcome that constructive and positive negotiations rather than ordering dictation are the framework, then at that time the results of the these negotiations become fruitful,” he said.

Tehran long has maintained its atomic program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, say Iran had an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003.

Wednesday saw the most-intense day of demonstrations, reaching rural towns and major cities in every province though still localized enough for daily life to continue in Tehran, Iran's capital, and elsewhere. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 38 people while more than 2,200 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. The growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran's civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So far, authorities haven't shut down the internet or fully flooded the streets with security forces like they did to put down the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations . But any intensification may seem them act. Meanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless, though a call for protests by Iran's exiled crown prince will test whether or not demonstrators are being swayed by messages from abroad. “The lack of a viable alternative has undermined past protests in Iran,” wrote Nate Swanson of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who studies Iran. “There may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wałęsa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country’s potential transformational leaders.” On Wednesday, at least 37 protests took place across the country, activists said. They included Shiraz, where online videos purported to show an anti-riot truck using a water cannon to target demonstrators. The state-run IRNA news agency, which has largely been silent about the demonstrations, reported on a mass demonstration in Bojnourd, as well as demonstrations in Kerman and Kermanshah. Iranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the protests. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed. The judiciary's Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province. Demonstrations continued Thursday, with merchants closing their shops in Iran’s Kurdistan province. It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. U.S. President Donald Trump’s warned last week that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” America “will come to their rescue.” Trump's comments drew a new rebuke from Iran's Foreign Ministry. “Recalling the long history of criminal interventions by successive U.S. administrations in Iran’s internal affairs, the Foreign Ministry considers claims of concern for the great Iranian nation to be hypocritical, aimed at deceiving public opinion and covering up the numerous crimes committed against Iranians,” it said. But those comments haven't stopped the U.S. State Department on the social platform X from highlighting online footage purporting to show demonstrators putting up stickers naming roads after Trump or throwing away government-subsidized rice. “When prices are set so high that neither consumers can afford to buy nor farmers can afford to sell, everyone loses,” the State Department said in one message. “It makes no difference if this rice is thrown away.” The demonstrations so far broadly appear to be leaderless, like other rounds of protests in Iran in recent years. However, Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah, has urged the public in Iran to shout from their windows and roofs on Thursday and Friday nights at 8 p.m. (1630 GMT). “Wherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time,” Pahlavi said in an online video that's also been promoted by Iranian satellite news channels abroad. “Based on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.” Whether people take part will be a sign of possible support for Pahlavi, whose support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi remains imprisoned by authorities after her arrest in December. “Since Dec. 28, 2025, the people of Iran have taken to the streets, just as they did in 2009, 2019,” her son Ali Rahmani said. “Each time, the same demands came up: an end to the Islamic Republic, an end to this patriarchal, dictatorial and religious regime, the end of the clerics, the end of the mullahs' regime.” Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran’s theocracy. Prior to Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials. Shops in markets across the country have shut down as part of the protests. This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. Amini was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. Her death became a rallying cry for women who continue to refuse to wear the hijab. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","Protests in Iran sparked by economic woes now nationwide, activists say Protests in Iran, driven by economic issues, have spread nationwide, challenging the country's theocracy DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Protests in Iran sparked by economic woes have now gone nationwide in the Islamic Republic, activists said Thursday, signaling both their staying power and intensity as they challenge the country's theocracy.

Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi remains imprisoned by authorities after her arrest in December. “Since Dec. 28, 2025, the people of Iran have taken to the streets, just as they did in 2009, 2019,” her son Ali Rahmani said. “Each time, the same demands came up: an end to the Islamic Republic, an end to this patriarchal, dictatorial and religious regime, the end of the clerics, the end of the mullahs' regime.” Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran’s theocracy. Prior to Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials. Shops in markets across the country have shut down as part of the protests. This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. Amini was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. Her death became a rallying cry for women who continue to refuse to wear the hijab. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",Politics,United States,POSITIVE,0.9949215054512024

The government of Aleppo province gave residents until 1 p.m. local time to evacuate in coordination with the army. State news agency SANA, citing the army, said the military would begin “targeted operations” against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the neighborhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud, Achrafieh and Bani Zaid half an hour after that deadline. The military later issued a series of maps with the areas under evacuation order. An Associated Press journalist at the scene heard sporadic sounds of shelling as civilians streamed out of the area Thursday morning. As of Wednesday, more than 46,000 people had been displaced across the province, according to Aleppo’s Directorate of Social Affairs and Labor. Mohammad Ali, operations director with the Syrian Civil Defense in Aleppo, said some 11,000 more fled Thursday. “There’s a large percentage of them with difficult medical issues, elderly people, women, and children,” he said. The SDF has said that at least eight civilians were killed in the Kurdish-majority neighborhoods, while government officials reported at least five civilians and one soldier have been killed in the surrounding government-controlled areas in the fighting that broke out Tuesday. Dozens more on both sides have been wounded. Each side has accused the other of deliberately targeting civilian neighborhoods and infrastructure. St. Ephrem Syrian Orthodox Church in Aleppo city was hosting about 100 people who had fled the fighting. Parishioners had donated mattresses, blankets and food, priest Adai Maher said. “As soon as the problems started and we heard the sounds (of clashes), we opened our church as a shelter for people who are fleeing their homes,"" he said. Among them was Georgette Lulu, who said her family is planning to travel to the city of Hasakeh in SDF-controlled northeast Syria when the security situation allows. “There was a lot of bombing and loud noises and a shell landed next to our house,” she said. “I’ve been through these circumstances a lot so I don’t get frightened, but my niece was really afraid so we had to come to the church.” Hassan Nader, a representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs in Aleppo said about 4,000 were staying in shelters in the city while tens of thousands had gone to other areas of the province, and the ministry was working with NGOs to supply them with food, medicine and other necessities. The clashes come amid an impasse in political negotiations between the central state and the SDF. The leadership in Damascus under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa signed a deal in March with the SDF, which controls much of the northeast, for it to merge with the Syrian army by the end of 2025. There have been disagreements on how it would happen. In April, scores of SDF fighters left Sheikh Maqsoud and Achrafieh as part of the deal. Officials from the central government and SDF met again on Sunday in Damascus, but government officials said that no tangible progress had been made. Some of the factions that make up the new Syrian army, formed after the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive in December 2024, were previously Turkey-backed insurgent groups that have a long history of clashing with Kurdish forces. In the city of Qamishli in the Kurdish-controlled northeast, thousands of protesters gathered Thursday, chanting in support of the SDF and against the government offensive. The SDF has for years been the main U.S. partner in Syria in fighting against the Islamic State group, but Turkey considers the SDF a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey. A peace process is now underway. Despite the long-running U.S. support for the SDF, the Trump administration in the U.S. has also developed close ties with al-Sharaa’s government and has pushed the Kurds to implement the March deal. A U.S. State Department official said in a statement Thursday that the U.S. “is closely monitoring the situation” and urged “restraint on all sides.” It said U.S. envoy Tom Barrack is trying to facilitate dialogue between the two sides. “All parties should focus on how to build a peaceful, stable Syria that protects and serves the interests of all Syrians, rather than pushing the country back into a cycle of violence,” the statement said. Turkey’s Ministry of National Defense said Thursday that the “operation is being carried out entirely by the Syrian Army” while Turkey is “closely monitoring.” “Syria’s security is our security,” the statement said, adding that “Turkey will provide the necessary support should Syria request it.” The United Nations has expressed concern at the violence. UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters Wednesday that Secretary General Antonio Guterres “is alarmed by reports of civilian deaths and injuries following hostilities in Aleppo.” “We call on all actors to immediately de-escalate, exercise maximum restraint, and take all measures to prevent further harm to civilians” and to “promptly resume negotiations in order to fully implement the 10 March agreement,” he said. ___ Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara contributed to this report.

China and Japan — frenemies, trading partners and uneasy neighbors with a tortured, bloody history they still struggle to navigate — are freshly at each other’s rhetorical throats as 2026 begins. And it’s over the same sticking points that have kept them resentful and suspicious for many decades: Japan’s occupation of parts of China in the 20th century, the use of military power in East Asia, economics and politics — and, of course, pride. From insinuations that Chinese citizens face dangers in Japan to outright accusations of resurgent Japanese imperialism, this first week of the year in China has been marked by the communist government scorning Tokyo on multiple fronts and noticeably embracing the visiting leader of another crucial strategic neighbor: South Korea. The latest chapter in Japan-China enmity surged In November when Japan's new leader waded into choppy bilateral waters. She said, in effect, that if China moved militarily against Taiwan, she wouldn't rule out involving Japan's constitutionally defense-only military. That didn't go over well in Beijing, which has teed off on Tokyo over the years for far less. “Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s erroneous remarks concerning Taiwan infringe upon China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, blatantly interfere in China’s internal affairs, and send a military threat against China,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday, a week after military exercises around the island ended . “We urge Japan to face up to the root causes of the issue, reflect and correct its mistakes.” That’s hardly uncommon language. China frequently demands Japan ponder the path it has taken and correct its “erroneous” course. It's rhetoric, sure, but it goes far deeper. And sometimes it's hard to tell what's real umbrage and what's ginned up for domestic political consumption. Because when it comes to the China-Japan relationship, anger remains a powerful and enduring tool on both sides. And there's no indication that's going away anytime soon. From the time Japan colonized Taiwan in 1895 after a war with Qing Dynasty China, a deep suspicion and at times outright enmity has existed between the two countries. It worsened in the 1920s and 1930s after Japan’s brutal occupation of parts of China resulted in torture and deaths that Chinese resent to this day. At the same time, Japanese leaders have sometimes thrown incendiary political footballs like visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese who gave their lives in the nation’s wars — including some war criminals from the Sino-Japanese wars. China, like clockwork, responds with indignation. Japan lost World War II to the Allied powers and relinquished offensive military powers under a U.S.-drafted constitution, even as the current communist Chinese government was establishing the People’s Republic in 1949. Since then, any hint of Japanese military assertiveness has drawn great umbrage here. Disputes over territory, such as an island chain called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, spike occasionally. The enmity, pulled out when something is perceived as aggressive or anger is required for a domestic audience, lurks barely beneath the surface, ready to pop. Even today, cartoons circulate online in China depicting Japanese as demonic, aggressive and anti-China. This week has been an illuminating case study. On Tuesday, China slapped restrictions on “dual-use exports” to Japan — anything, it said, that Japan could adapt for military use. Though it didn't specify what the ban includes, anything from drones to rare earths could be considered dual-use. The lack of specificity allows China to adjust its approach as it goes — making it more or less strict depending on where the political winds are blowing. Japan demanded the move be rescinded. “These measures, which only target Japan, deviate significantly from international practice,” its Foreign Ministry said, calling China's actions “absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable.” This came days after it protested Chinese mobile drilling rigs in the East China Sea. While the Chinese Commerce Ministry did not mention rare earths curbs, the official newspaper China Daily, seen as a government mouthpiece, quoted anonymous sources saying Beijing was considering tightening exports of certain rare earths to Japan. On Wednesday, the focus turned to a gas called dichlorosilane, used in computer chip manufacturing. The Commerce Ministry said it had launched an investigation into why the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024. “The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,” it said. Finally, on Thursday, China's Arms Control and Disarmament Association, a nongovernment agency (inasmuch as any agency in China is nongovernmental) released with some fanfare a report provocatively titled “Nuclear Ambitions of Japan's Right-Wing Forces: A Serious Threat to World Peace.” It spent 29 pages outlining worries and accusations that Tokyo harbors dangerous nuclear ambitions. But it also went broader, invoking once again its stance that the nation's right-wing leaders — and, by extension, the whole country itself — have “failed to reflect on Japan's history of aggression.” “Japan has never been able to fully eliminate the scourge of militarism in the country,” the report said. “If Japan's right-wing forces are left free to develop powerful offensive weapons, or even possess nuclear weapons, it will again bring disaster to the world.” Also part of the equation this week: China's visible pivot to another regional neighbor, South Korea, whose president spent four days in Beijing. Seoul has a bumpy history of its own with Japanese aggression and also sporadic — though generally less intense — friction with Beijing, a longtime supporter and ally of its rival North Korea. Chinese media gave splashy coverage to Lee Jae Myung's visit, touting new Beijing-Seoul agreements on trade, environmental protection and transportation — and notably technology, given the dual-export ban. Also visible: Lee at two business events watching major companies pledge increased collaboration. The sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources. The burst of official affection toward South Korea didn't stop with Lee. While he was here, Chinese media reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from the mainland over New Year’s. That's on top of Beijing's recent efforts to discourage Chinese from traveling to Japan, citing “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens” there. For now, Japan-China tension remains a matter of rhetoric and policy. But no one is predicting a quick resolution. With Japan's staunch ally, the United States, planning to furnish more arms to Taiwan in a single sale than ever before, there's too much at stake for both East Asian nations at this moment — and too much contentious history — for an easy and quick solution. ""This time ... de-escalation and a return to the status quo may not be as easily achieved,"" Sebastian Maslow, an East Asia specialist and associate professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo, wrote in The Conversation last month. “With diplomatic channels in short supply and domestic political agendas paramount, an off-ramp for the current dispute is not in sight.” ___ Ted Anthony has written about China for The Associated Press since 1994. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","China and Japan, uneasy neighbors in East Asia, are at odds again They’re at it again BEIJING -- They’re at it again.

abc_world,Lebanese military moves to new phase of disarming non-state groups like Hezbollah,"The Lebanese military says it has ended the first phase of its plan to deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, including Hezbollah",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/lebanese-military-moves-new-phase-disarmament-plan-state-129009711,"Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:05:59 -0500",2026-01-08 07:05:59-05:00,"The Lebanese military says it has ended the first phase of its plan to deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, including Hezbollah BEIRUT -- The Lebanese military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of their plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah. Israel said it is encouraging but “far from sufficient.” The effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024. The military's statement didn't name Hezbollah or other armed groups in particular, but it comes before President Joseph Aoun is set to meet with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and his government to discuss the deployment and disarmament plans. Both said disarming non-state groups was a priority upon beginning their terms not long after the ceasefire went into effect. Lebanon's top officials have endorsed the military announcement. A statement by Aoun’s office ahead of the meeting called on Israel to stop its attacks, withdraw from areas it occupies, and release Lebanese prisoners. He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah. Speaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection."" Israel maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon. “The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,"" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.” The text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani river should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river. Hezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country. The Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels , rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September. The government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons. “The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities,” it said. Hezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese military’s announcement. Officials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali River, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase. Israel still strikes Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control. Regular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire. Lebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani River and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps. Israel accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts. Lebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war. Hezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory. The latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians. Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened. Hezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","Lebanese military moves to new phase of disarming non-state groups like Hezbollah The Lebanese military says it has ended the first phase of its plan to deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, including Hezbollah BEIRUT -- The Lebanese military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of their plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.

He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah. Speaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection."" Israel maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon. “The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,"" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.” The text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani river should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river. Hezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country. The Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels , rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September. The government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons. “The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities,” it said. Hezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese military’s announcement. Officials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali River, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase. Israel still strikes Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control. Regular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire. Lebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani River and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps. Israel accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts. Lebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war. Hezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory. The latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians. Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened. Hezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",Security,United States,NEGATIVE,0.9970319271087646

The commission will investigate the nature, prevalence and drivers of antisemitism generally as well as the circumstances of the Bondi mass shooting, Albanese told reporters in Canberra on Thursday. It will also make recommendations for law enforcement, strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of extremism. A royal commission, which is the most powerful form of government-commissioned inquiry that can be held in Australia, has the power to summon witnesses and request documents as evidence. It will be led by former High Court judge Virginia Bell, Albanese said. A report is due by Dec. 14, which will be a year to the day since the shooting during a Hanukkah celebration at the Sydney landmark. “This was an antisemitic terrorist attack, aimed at Jewish Australians, inspired by ISIS, the deadliest that has ever occurred on Australian soil,"" said Albanese, referring to the Islamic State group.

The UAE had no immediate reaction to the claim, which further escalates tensions between the neighboring nations on the Arabian Peninsula as their partnership in the yearslong war in Yemen breaks down. A Saudi military statement claimed Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of the Southern Transitional Council, fled Yemen by boat to Somalia. Then, UAE officials flew al-Zubaidi to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the Emirates, the statement said. The UAE has been the major supporter of the council, known as the STC, which sparked a confrontation between Saudi Arabia and the Emirates in recent days after STC fighters advanced in two governorates and appeared to be preparing to secede from Yemen . The Saudi statement from Maj. Gen. Turki al-Malki included him naming a major general in the UAE as being involved in al-Zubaidi's alleged escape, along with identifying his nom de guerre — something highly unusual in the typical clubby world of Gulf Arab relations. It also suggested an Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft used in the operation had been used in “conflict zones” like Ethiopia, Libya and Somalia — routes the Emirati military has been accused of funneling weapons through in the past. The UAE has denied running guns into those areas. The Emirati Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. The STC did not immediately acknowledge the allegation either, saying Wednesday that al-Zubaidi had remained in Aden, where forces allied against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels had congregated for years since the rebels seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa. Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jaber, said on X Thursday morning that he met with the STC delegation that landed in Riyadh a day earlier. They discussed al-Zubaidi's recent actions, which he said “harmed the southern cause and didn't serve it.” “We also explored ways to work in the future to address what happened in a manner that serves the Southern cause, the Coalition’s efforts to achieve security and stability in Yemen, and we addressed the arrangements for the Southern Cause Conference, which will be held in Riyadh soon,” he added. Meanwhile, Mohamed al-Ghaithi, an STC member and head of the negotiation and reconciliation committee supporting the Presidential Leadership Council, called the meeting with al-Jaber “fruitful"" and praised the kingdom's initiative to sponsor the conference aimed at finding a resolution in the south. Al-Ghaithi confirmed that the delegation “rejected everything that harms unity.” “We have heard clear commitments from our brothers in Riyadh towards our people’s cause and ensuring a secure and stable future,” he added in a post on X. On Wednesday, the STC had said it lost contact with it's delegation after they landed in Riyadh, with a Council representative saying that members' cellphones were either switched off or ringing with no one answering. Southern Yemen had been run under the Presidential Leadership Council, a group including al-Zubaidi and others, since 2022. On Wednesday, the leadership council expelled al-Zubaidi and charged him with treason after he apparently declined to fly to Saudi Arabia for talks. It marked the latest pushback against the STC by Saudi Arabia, which also recently launched airstrikes against the group and an arms shipment the kingdom said came from the UAE. The war in Yemen, on the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula and bordering the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians. It has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. The Houthis have also launched attacks against shipping over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, disrupting a vital route for global commerce.

Authorities in the city of Catania have suspended or restricted excursions to see the volcano's lava flows, prompting guides to go on strike for the first time in decades and leaving disgruntled tourists with fewer options to see the spectacle up close. Dozens of the guides demonstrated Wednesday in front of Mount Etna’s lava flow gate, calling the new restrictions excessive and saying the lava flows are slow-moving enough to be viewed safely as has been done in the past. “These measures effectively nullify the role of guides, stripping them of their skills, function, and professional responsibility,” a statement by the guides’ regional board said. The lava flows are especially spectacular after sunset, but under the new rules, excursions are allowed only until dusk and can go no closer than 200 meters (660 feet) to the lava flow. Also, a previously existing limit of 10 people per group is being vigorously enforced, including with drones. Mount Etna is Europe’s most active volcano and the continent’s largest. It attracts hikers and backpackers to its slopes, while less adventurous tourists can take it in from a distance, most stunningly from the Ionian Sea. At 3,350 meters (almost 10,990 feet) tall and 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) wide, the Sicilian giant frequently offers a front-row seat to nature’s power. Last June, a massive eruption forced tourists to flee the volcano after a plume of high-temperature gases, ash and rock several kilometers high billowed into the air above them. The latest restrictions were adopted after Mount Etna started a round of eruptions on Christmas Eve. The most advanced lava front reached 1,360 meters (4,460 feet) above sea level, before stopping and entering a cooling phase after a journey of approximately 3.4 kilometers (about 2 miles), local authorities said. The lava flow poses no danger to nearby residential areas, volcanologists say. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology confirmed this week that Mount Etna’s eruption is ongoing, but said the lava fronts are cooling and not advancing further. “This is a lava flow that is descending very slowly on an area that is now also flat or semi-flat,” said Dario Teri, 43, a member of Sicily’s association of alpine and volcano guides who participated in Wednesday’s protest. The guides, who are expected to continue their strike in the coming days, hope to come to a compromise with authorities that can protect their profession while also ensuring the safety of visitors.

One of the leaders is Abdikani Ali Mohamed, a teenage-faced colonel whose authority has grown in the city as Somalia’s government tries to dismantle al-Shabab networks. Mohamed's operatives are so suspicious that even an armored vehicle — the ultimate status symbol beloved by important people — triggers alarm if it has not passed through a checkpoint for days. “What we have clearly understood is these people ( al-Shabab ) are always evolving,” Mohamed said. “The strategy is always evolving in terms of attack mechanisms and the complexity they are utilizing.” After his election in 2022, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud declared a “total war” against the militants who oppose his fragile government and are responsible for killing or maiming thousands of people over the years. He has vowed to attack al-Shabab on the frontlines but also to target its finances and standing among ordinary Somalis. Somalia has been without a properly functional central government since the overthrow by warlords of the dictator Siad Barre in 1991. Authorities have said that the effort to stop al-Shabab — an operation backed by African Union peacekeepers and military advisers from countries such as Egypt and Turkey — must be led by intelligence gatherers, putting the National Intelligence and Security Agency, or NISA, at the center of the unwieldy security apparatus trying to keep the federal government operational. The last major attack by al-Shabab came in August 2024 and killed dozens at the city’s Lido beach, although there have been ambitious plots like the failed attempt to assassinate the president in March and a prison attack in October. Security officials claim success because of the rarity these days of major attacks in Mogadishu by al-Shabab, which is fighting to impose Islamic law in the Horn of Africa nation. The group has ties to al-Qaida. A “ring of steel” around Mogadishu makes it harder for al-Shabab to penetrate the city, said Abdi Guled, a Somali who is an independent analyst of the Horn. “The integration of high-tech surveillance and improved intelligence sharing has disrupted several cells, but this remains a tactical success.” Attacks by al-Shabab typically involve improvised explosive devices hidden in cars and detonated at strategic locations, especially the gates of popular hotels and government buildings. The most powerful bombings have killed hundreds of civilians at a time. Hotels, restaurants, and other places frequented by government officials are now shielded by concrete barriers, while the presidency and most embassies are ensconced in a fortified zone near the airport, whose security is Mohamed's responsibility. “For us we are at war,” Mohamed said, describing his work after inspecting checkpoints in Mogadishu, where security measures now also mandate shop owners to install security cameras. “This is a battle that is going to be back and forth — and one we are winning currently.” Facing military pressure, including occasional U.S. airstrikes, al-Shabab has retreated to areas of southern and central Somalia that suit its guerrilla tactics. Beyond Mogadishu, the conflict “has shifted from a rapid offensive to a grinding war of attrition” as al-Shabab fighters retreat under pressure to resupply and then ambush government troops and their allies in remote towns, according to Guled. In parts of Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region – the country’s food basket and now also a battleground in the fight with al-Shabab – confrontations between government troops and the militants have become more frequent in recent months. There are mixed results for government troops in towns like Bariire, the control of which has shifted multiple times in the past year. As the holy month of Ramadan came to a close in March, al Shabab fighters overran Bariire, torching homes and forcing people to flee. Daynab Mukhtar Aden, a 65-year-old mother of six, told The Associated Press that she walked 40 kilometers (24 miles) from Bariire a settlement for the displaced near Mogadishu. “If we had stayed we would have been killed,” said Aden, a tea vendor who works under a tree next to the shell of what used to be her house. She returned to Bariire only after government troops retook the city and declared it – yet again – liberated. “I came back because we were told the government will help us rebuild and keep us safe,” she said. But the fighting had left a trail of carnage. Al-Shabab fighters were blamed for destroying bridges and effectively impeding easy access to three towns served by the Shabelle River. ""The enemy fighters (al-Shabab) are sophisticated and skilled in their tactics, which constantly presents new challenges,” said Lt. Col. Abdirahim Mohammed Munye of the Somali military, citing successive victories against al-Shabab in Bariire and the nearby areas of Sabid-Anole and Awdheegle. “However, with the help of Allah, we hope to gain the upper hand and liberate our country.” Munye pointed out that degrading al-Shabab in Lower Shabelle — and reclaiming towns like Bariire — is key to securing Mogadishu, where residents see the heavy security presence as reassuring. There are construction sites across Mogadishu, a city of just under 3 million people. Cafes and ice cream parlors are sprouting, and at night the neon lights come on in the main thoroughfares, emitting the kind of life that Mogadishu's senior residents hope for. “Insecurity has been one of our biggest challenges,” said Hajji Abuker Osman, a retiree who regularly comes to have coffee in downtown Mogadishu. “It has really improved now.” ___ Njehia reported from Bariire, Somalia. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","Somalia's fight against extremist militants shows signs of success on the streets of Mogadishu Mogadishu’s first line of defense against the next militant attack on Somalia’s capital ranges from machine gunners in pick-up trucks to young men in plainclothes manning checkpoints MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Mogadishu's first line of defense against the next militant attack on Somalia ’s capital ranges from machine gunners in pick-up trucks to young men in plainclothes manning checkpoints.

He has vowed to attack al-Shabab on the frontlines but also to target its finances and standing among ordinary Somalis. Somalia has been without a properly functional central government since the overthrow by warlords of the dictator Siad Barre in 1991. Authorities have said that the effort to stop al-Shabab — an operation backed by African Union peacekeepers and military advisers from countries such as Egypt and Turkey — must be led by intelligence gatherers, putting the National Intelligence and Security Agency, or NISA, at the center of the unwieldy security apparatus trying to keep the federal government operational. The last major attack by al-Shabab came in August 2024 and killed dozens at the city’s Lido beach, although there have been ambitious plots like the failed attempt to assassinate the president in March and a prison attack in October. Security officials claim success because of the rarity these days of major attacks in Mogadishu by al-Shabab, which is fighting to impose Islamic law in the Horn of Africa nation. The group has ties to al-Qaida. A “ring of steel” around Mogadishu makes it harder for al-Shabab to penetrate the city, said Abdi Guled, a Somali who is an independent analyst of the Horn. “The integration of high-tech surveillance and improved intelligence sharing has disrupted several cells, but this remains a tactical success.” Attacks by al-Shabab typically involve improvised explosive devices hidden in cars and detonated at strategic locations, especially the gates of popular hotels and government buildings. The most powerful bombings have killed hundreds of civilians at a time. Hotels, restaurants, and other places frequented by government officials are now shielded by concrete barriers, while the presidency and most embassies are ensconced in a fortified zone near the airport, whose security is Mohamed's responsibility. “For us we are at war,” Mohamed said, describing his work after inspecting checkpoints in Mogadishu, where security measures now also mandate shop owners to install security cameras. “This is a battle that is going to be back and forth — and one we are winning currently.” Facing military pressure, including occasional U.S. airstrikes, al-Shabab has retreated to areas of southern and central Somalia that suit its guerrilla tactics. Beyond Mogadishu, the conflict “has shifted from a rapid offensive to a grinding war of attrition” as al-Shabab fighters retreat under pressure to resupply and then ambush government troops and their allies in remote towns, according to Guled. In parts of Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region – the country’s food basket and now also a battleground in the fight with al-Shabab – confrontations between government troops and the militants have become more frequent in recent months. There are mixed results for government troops in towns like Bariire, the control of which has shifted multiple times in the past year. As the holy month of Ramadan came to a close in March, al Shabab fighters overran Bariire, torching homes and forcing people to flee. Daynab Mukhtar Aden, a 65-year-old mother of six, told The Associated Press that she walked 40 kilometers (24 miles) from Bariire a settlement for the displaced near Mogadishu. “If we had stayed we would have been killed,” said Aden, a tea vendor who works under a tree next to the shell of what used to be her house. She returned to Bariire only after government troops retook the city and declared it – yet again – liberated. “I came back because we were told the government will help us rebuild and keep us safe,” she said. But the fighting had left a trail of carnage. Al-Shabab fighters were blamed for destroying bridges and effectively impeding easy access to three towns served by the Shabelle River. ""The enemy fighters (al-Shabab) are sophisticated and skilled in their tactics, which constantly presents new challenges,” said Lt. Col. Abdirahim Mohammed Munye of the Somali military, citing successive victories against al-Shabab in Bariire and the nearby areas of Sabid-Anole and Awdheegle. “However, with the help of Allah, we hope to gain the upper hand and liberate our country.” Munye pointed out that degrading al-Shabab in Lower Shabelle — and reclaiming towns like Bariire — is key to securing Mogadishu, where residents see the heavy security presence as reassuring. There are construction sites across Mogadishu, a city of just under 3 million people. Cafes and ice cream parlors are sprouting, and at night the neon lights come on in the main thoroughfares, emitting the kind of life that Mogadishu's senior residents hope for. “Insecurity has been one of our biggest challenges,” said Hajji Abuker Osman, a retiree who regularly comes to have coffee in downtown Mogadishu. “It has really improved now.” ___ Njehia reported from Bariire, Somalia. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",Security,United States,POSITIVE,0.6730819344520569

It is the first visit to China by a Canadian prime minister in more than eight years. Xi invited Carney to China when they met during an Asia-Pacific summit in October.

abc_world,Mexico becomes crucial fuel supplier to Cuba but pledges no extra shipments after Maduro toppled,Mexico has emerged as a key fuel supplier to Havana as the United States prepares to seize control of Venezuelan oil and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump hardens its stance toward Cuba,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-crucial-fuel-supplier-cuba-pledges-extra-shipments-128991485,"Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:13:55 -0500",2026-01-07 15:13:55-05:00,"Mexico has emerged as a key fuel supplier to Havana as the United States prepares to seize control of Venezuelan oil and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump hardens its stance toward Cuba MEXICO CITY -- As the United States prepares to seize control of Venezuelan oil and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump hardens its stance toward Cuba , Mexico has emerged as a key fuel supplier to Havana. It’s a role that could further complicate already strained relations with the Trump administration, even though the Mexican government insists that exports to the island have not increased. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledged on Wednesday that “with the current situation in Venezuela, Mexico has become an important supplier” of crude oil to Cuba, but asserted that “no more oil is being sent than has been sent historically; there is no specific shipment.” She added that those shipments are made via “contracts” or as “humanitarian aid,” but offered no concrete figures on the number of barrels exported. Following the 1959 revolution that toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista, the U.S. imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in response to the nationalization of American-owned property. Under the embargo — long denounced by many countries, including Mexico — Cubans have suffered economic and energy crises , driving hundreds of thousands of Cubans to migrate, especially to the United States. Blackouts that last up to eight hours and long lines at gas stations are routine across Cuba. José Martínez, a 65-year-old former construction worker and resident of Old Havana whose power goes out daily, said the upheaval in Venezuela will impact Cuba. “The blackouts are going to intensify with all this,” he said, adding that he believes the U.S. attacked because they want Venezuela's oil. “They own the world.” Meanwhile, street vendor Yeison Gálvez, 37, worries about the impact on transportation: “For as long as I can remember, we’ve depended on Venezuela for fuel. We’re going to be walking even more."" It's unclear if any country would increase oil shipments to Cuba after the U.S. attack on Venezuela. The Mexican government has avoided commenting on its future plans. Exports to Cuba represent a very small percentage of total exports — 3.3% — but their economic profitability is questionable, and Pemex’s production continues to decline. From January to Sept. 30, 2025, Mexico shipped 19,200 barrels per day to Cuba: 17,200 barrels of crude oil and 2,000 barrels of refined products, according to the most recent report that state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for data. Jorge Piñón, of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, who tracks shipments using oil tracking services and satellite technology, shared similar data this week with The Associated Press for the same period. He had tracked 22,000 barrels per day and said that the figure dropped to 7,000 barrels after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Mexico City in September 2025. Meanwhile, in the last three months, Maduro’s government exported an average of 35,000 barrels a day to Cuba, approximately a quarter of the island’s total demand, according to Piñón . The academic saw no likelihood that Mexico would increase its shipments: “The U.S. government would go bonkers,” he said. “There will be more pressure from the United States regarding Cuba,” said Oscar Ocampo of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, adding that oil will predictably be one of the areas under pressure, a view shared by many experts. Mexico has historically sent oil to Cuba, especially during periods of power blackouts and social unrest. After widespread protests in Cuba in 2021, Mexico sent one of its largest humanitarian aid shipments, which included 100,000 barrels of fuel. And in October 2024, it sent more than 400,000 barrels in just a few days following serious blackouts in Cuba, according to data provided at the time by Piñón. “The way this has been done also incentivizes opacity,” Ocampo said, because since 2023, the shipments have been made via private Pemex subsidiary, Gasolinas Bienestar, whose financial situation “is not transparent.” In its report to the SEC, Pemex states that the shipments to Cuba were valued at approximately $400 million and were “sales” made through contracts at market price. But Ocampo says it cannot clearly be determined whether that was the case or if they were discounted shipments, with some kind of quid pro quo — perhaps the deployment of doctors — or as humanitarian aid. The foreseeable lack of profitability in supplying oil to Cuba comes as 2025 is set to become the year in which Pemex exported the least amount of crude oil, “with less than 600,000 barrels per day, when just a couple of years ago we exported more than 1 million,” Ocampo said. ___ Associated Press reporters Andrea Rodríguez in Havana and Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","Mexico becomes crucial fuel supplier to Cuba but pledges no extra shipments after Maduro toppled Mexico has emerged as a key fuel supplier to Havana as the United States prepares to seize control of Venezuelan oil and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump hardens its stance toward Cuba MEXICO CITY -- As the United States prepares to seize control of Venezuelan oil and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump hardens its stance toward Cuba , Mexico has emerged as a key fuel supplier to Havana.

Police escorted the 70-year-old Bolsonaro from the federal police's headquarters in Brasilia to the nearby DF Star hospital where he arrived at around midday for three brain tests. At around 4:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT), Bolsonaro's wife Michelle said on Instagram that the exams had been carried out and that they were awaiting results. Her husband went back to prison, she said. Later, DF Star hospital said in a brief statement that the tests showed “mild soft-tissue thickening in the frontal and right temporal regions"" due to the trauma, but that no additional treatment was needed. Bolsonaro fell in his cell overnight from Monday to Tuesday while sleeping. His wife, and Bolsonaro's son Carlos, said on social media Tuesday that the far-right politician needed medical attention and expressed frustration that Bolsonaro hadn't been sent to the hospital on Tuesday. In his decision authorizing the trip to the hospital Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes cited a health report conducted by the federal police on Tuesday. Bolsonaro reported mild head trauma, according to the report. Upon examination, the former Brazilian leader was found to be conscious and lucid, with a superficial cut to his face. De Moraes authorized a tomography, brain scan and a brain wave test requested by Bolsonaro’s lawyers. The Supreme Court justice said that his transfer to the hospital should be conducted in a “discreet manner,” and that federal police were responsible for Bolsonaro’s security and his return to prison. Bolsonaro had previously left the hospital and returned to prison last Thursday, a week after undergoing double hernia surgery. Bolsonaro has been hospitalized multiple times since being stabbed at a campaign event before the 2018 presidential election. Bolsonaro and several of his allies were convicted in September by a panel of Supreme Court justices of attempting to overthrow Brazil’s democratic system following his 2022 election defeat. The plot included plans to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. There was also a plan to encourage an insurrection in early 2023.

So therefore, we must, safeguard this priceless currency by remaining a trusted and reliable trading partner.” He said that EU negotiations over Mercosur will continue on Friday amid speculation that a deal could be signed in Paraguay on Jan. 12. Fierce opposition from France in December, fired up by enraged farmers, derailed the deal and forced European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to scrap a trip to Brazil where top EU officials had hoped to sign the EU-Mercosur deal after 26 years of negotiations .

The Mercosur trade deal covers a market of 780 million people and a quarter of the globe’s gross domestic product, and would progressively remove duties on almost all goods traded between the two blocs.

The EU is seeking to forge new trade ties amid commercial tensions with the U.S. and China, and the December delay of Mercosur was seen to diminish the EU’s negotiating credibility.

His centrist government has demanded safeguards to monitor and stop large economic disruption in the EU, increased regulations in the Mercosur nations like pesticide restrictions, and more inspections of imports at EU ports. French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard reaffirmed Wednesday France’s opposition to the Mercosur deal, because she said it threatens sectors including beef, chicken, sugar, ethanol and honey. “As long as the combat is not over, nothing is lost,” she told French news broadcaster France Info, referring to the ongoing negotiations over the deal. If the EU Commission signs the deal on Jan. 12, it will be debated at the European Parliament, she said. “There’s no guarantee the deal will be approved by the European Parliament,” she said.

The political tensions that have marked Mercosur in recent years — especially between Argentina’s far-right President Javier Milei and Brazil’s center-left Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , the bloc’s two main partners — have not deterred South American leaders from pursuing an alliance with Europe that will benefit their agricultural sectors.
